            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onſidering the great vſe and profite of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie worke of <hi>Actes and Monumentes,</hi> written by Maſter <hi>Iohn Fox,</hi> of bleſſed memorie: and by reaſon of the largenes of the volume, and great price, how the most were bereaued of the benefite of ſo neceſſarie an Hiſtorie: J often wiſhed, ſome man would take the paines to draw the ſame into an Abridgement: that, both thoſe that are buſied in affaires, or not able to reach to the price of ſo great a booke, might alſo haue vſe of the hiſtorie with them that neither want leiſure, nor hability ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. But, ſeeing hetherto nothing done that way, nor hearing of any that had it in purpoſe, J ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tured vpon the labor my ſelf, &amp; thus haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it for thy vſe: wherein, J haue omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to my remembrance, and as my iudgement ſerued me, that is materiall to the hiſtorie, ſo farre as the nature of an Abridgement would permitte. As for Treatiſes, Diſputations, Epiſtles, and ſuch like, J leaue them to be read all together in the large Booke: which I doe exhort thee (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
<pb facs="tcp:2659:3"/> the rather for my Abridgements ſake, to buy, and vſe. For, as the copiouſnes of that notable worke, hath hid the riche treaſures of the ſame, through charge of price, and mens affaires: So this my labour may geue thee an aſſay, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, to know further, whereof thou maiſt here take (as it were) the taſte. J aſſure thee, in mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, there is not a booke, vnder the Scriptures, more neceſſarie for a Chriſtian to be conuerſant in. There is no Burgeſſe of a Citie, that hath care of his corporation, but would be glad to know, how in times paſt, the world went with his Corporatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that therby he may vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the better how to be haue himſelfe therein, as occaſion ſhall ſerue: and, not onely woulde deſire to knowe the lawes of the ſame, but alſo, what examples haue any way beene geuen, touching the ſame. Euen ſo, it becommeth much more Christians, that are Citizens of the church of Christ, and haue a communitie in that bodie, to know, not onely the lawes of this Citie, (which is the word of God) but alſo, what hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen, either good, or bad, and euerye accident: whereupon, experience may ariſe by example, and wiſdome thereof, to be put in vſe accordingly. We may read what hath befallen the worthiest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths in this world, and what ſtormes they
<pb facs="tcp:2659:3"/> haue endured, and all ſunke, vnder them. This Common-wealth of the Church ſtandeth for euer, though the ſtormes that haue blowen vpon it, haue beene more boysterous than any other ſtate hath endured. And by reaſon of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, geueth great varietie of examples: of Gods prouidence, of his mercie, of his fatherly chaſtizements, and correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of that holy faith, which hath miniſtred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible ſtrength of conſtancie, &amp; patience to this heauenly ſtate of Chriſtes Church, in the middest of all ſtormes of tryall. And here mayſt thou reade, not onely what hath beene ſuffered of the olde Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the church, who haue with their bloud pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed vnto vs this freedome of the Goſpell: but of late times, what thy father, thy mother, thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, and thy frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d haue ſuffered for like teſtimonie, wherby the ſincerity of the Goſpel ſtandeth at this day. When (I ſay) in this Abridgement, thou maiſt reade theſe things, J mean much more in the large volume, where all ſuch matters lie open at the full: and whereto (I pray thee) let this my labour be (as it were) an introduction. And if thy hability ſerue thee, or any other diſpoſition thereto, J pray thee let not this booke withdraw thee. For, Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in all kinde of learning, haue byn vſed, for ſuch reſpects as J haue before mentioned: beſides,
<pb facs="tcp:2659:4"/> the memorie embraceth them more readily: and not to hinder great volumes. Neither doo they of their own nature, work ſuch effect. If ſlouth of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons neglect them, ſo are they puniſhed therfore in wanting that belongeth vnto them to know: &amp; yet through Abridgementes, haue ſome furniture of that profitable inſtruction, whereof otherwiſe they would be vtterly ignorant. It is ſaid, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> Abridgement loſt <hi>Trogus Pompeius: Trogus</hi> peraduenture is loſt, but whether through <hi>Iuſtines</hi> Abridgement, that hardly can be proued: and had it not beene for <hi>Iuſtine,</hi> we had lost with <hi>Trogus,</hi> the hiſtory too. The caſe is far otherwiſe ſince printing was knowen: for, who would loſe a leafe of <hi>Liuie,</hi> for any Abridgement. Before, it may be, charge of written Copies might be ſome cauſe, why the large volumes were not ſo vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall. And I pray thee, if the Author him ſelf (the fitteſt of all men, being an Hiſtory ſo meet, euen for the meanest Chriſtian, eſpecially in theſe times, and conteyning recordes of ſuch things, as are els no where to be had) had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it in hand: had it not byn thanks-woorthy?

His dreame was, that Laterane Church was ready to fall, &amp; he with his ſhoulders was faine to hold it: wherevpon Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick had his petitition granted.

               <p>The minorities deſcend from one <hi>Francis,</hi> an Italian, of the citie of Aſſiſſium, who hearing that Chriſt ſent forth his diſciples to preach, thought to imitate the ſame in himſelfe, &amp; his diſciples: and ſo left of ſhoes, had but one coate,<note place="margin">The perfection of the Goſpel.</note> and that of a coorſe cloth, in ſtéed of a latchet to his ſhoe, and a girdle, tooke a Hempen cord, and apparrelled his diſciples, teaching them (as he ſaid) the perfection of the Goſpel, to apprehend pouerty, and to walke in the way of holy ſimplicity. He left in wryting to his Diſciples, and followers, his rule, which he called the Rule of the Goſpell. He was very ſeuere in outward chaſtiſing of him ſelfe, ſo that in Winter, he coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his bodie with iſe, and ſnowe. He called pouertie, his Ladie. He kept nothing ouer night. So deſirous he was of martirdome, that he went into Siria, to the Souldan, who receiued him honorablie: for he tolde him not the trueth, as <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> did to <hi>Herod.</hi>

               <p>The Pope hearing of this, ſendeth his letters to the king vpon the ſame, threatning him with excommunication, to ſearch out the doers of the fact, &amp; to puniſh them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: likewiſe he ſent the ſame charge to <hi>Peter</hi> biſhop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, and to the Abbot of Saint <hi>Edmunds,</hi> to inquire in the South partes: to the biſhop of Durham, and the Archb. of Yorke, and to Maſter <hi>Iohn</hi> Chanon of Yorke a Romane, to inquire in the North partes for the ſaid malefactors. So that earneſt inquiſition, being made, diuers were found fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers, and diuers euen of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cleargy: but the chiefe author was ſuppoſed to be <hi>Hugo de Burge,</hi> L. chiefe iuſtice, who both with the kings letters, &amp; his own, fortified y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that no man durſt interrupt them. Moreouer, in the ſame ſociety, was <hi>R.

Then the king, and other executors of the Popes commandement, counſelled him to offer himſelfe to the pope to be abſolued, and there to make declaration of his cauſe.

When the day was come, that <hi>Hubert</hi> muſt appeare, kéeping amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the monks of Merton, he durſt not ſhewe himſelfe: whereat the King being offended, directed his letters in all haſt to the mayor of London: commaunding him to muſter, and take vp all that could beare harneſſe in London, and by force of armes, to bring him <hi>Hubert</hi> either quicke, or dead, out of Merton: which was accompliſhed.<note place="margin">The Londo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hate <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</hi>

               <p>In the meane ſeaſon, while the Citizens were on their iournie, it was ſuggeſted to the king by <hi>Radolph,</hi> Biſhop of Chicheſter, and Lord Chancellour, that it was dangerous to raiſe vp the rude multitude for feare of ſedition. Moreouer, what ſhalbe ſaid (quoth he) among the Frenchmen, &amp; other Nations, but thus (ieſtingly, and in mockerie) ſee what a kinde birde is this young king of England, that ſéeketh to

Whereof, when the king was certified, (fearing leaſt he ſhould make ſome commotion in the Realme) ſendeth in haſtie anger after him, Sir <hi>Godfrey Crancombe,</hi> knight with <hi>300.</hi> men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them vnder paine of hanging, that they ſhoulde bring him to the Tower of London.

               <p>Afterwarde, the Emperor prepared himſelfe to the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney againſt the Saracens, and recouerie of Ieruſalem, but was ſtayed by ſicknes, all other things being in a readines.

His diſeaſe grew vpon him againe, and ſodainlie he fell ſicke: whereof the Pope hearing, thundered againſt him excommunications, and curſes, laying moſt foule, &amp; falſe crimes to his charge.

               <p>During which time of truce, the Pope ſendeth priuily to the Townſmen of Aruagum, deſiring them to ſaue his life: which if they would doe, he promiſed to enrich them, that they ſhould all haue cauſe neuer to forget,<note place="margin">The Pope reiected.</note> or to repent the benefite beſtowed.

               <p>About the ſame yere, the king began the foundation of ij. Monaſteries: one, of the Friers obſeruants on the one ſide of Thames:<note place="margin">H.

               <p>About Michaelmas the ſame yere, the king began his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement at Leiceſter: in which, the Commons put vp their bill againe, which they had put vp before, <hi>anno 11.

               <p>Now, about this time, <hi>Io. Huſſe,</hi> preaching at his church of Bethlehem, was accuſed therefore by ſome,<note place="margin">

               <p>In this mean time, the greateſt aduerſary that <hi>Ioh.

That the Cardinals are not the true ſucceſſors of the apoſtles of Chriſt, except they faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelues to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kéeping of Chriſts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements. That eccleſiaſticall cenſure ought not to procéede to execution of death. That the nobles of the world ought to compel the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the church, to kéepe the law of Ieſus Chriſt. That the Cleargies eccleſiaſtical obedience is inuented without warrant of the ſcriptures. That he appealed from the Pope to Chriſt, and did not eſtéeme the Popes curſes. That a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man liueth vitiouſtly, and a godly man godlily. That if a miniſter be wrongfully forbidden to preach, he ought not to obey, for any commandement of power to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, becauſe it is a worke not of indifferency, but of expreſſe commandement. The next article was almoſt one with this. That the eccleſiaſticall cenſures are antichriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which <hi>Huſſe</hi> denied to be vttred in that form. That there ought no interditement, or curſe to be appointed vnto the people. And theſe were the articles both alleadged out of his booke of the Church, and by himſelfe auouched before them. Beſides theſe, there were other articles brought againſt him: among which were <hi>19.</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> brought him into priſon. That <hi>Paul</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to preſent iuſtice, was a blaſphemer, but the childe of God by predeſtination. That Chriſt more loueth a predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate man, being ſinful, then a reprobate, in what grace ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he be for the time. That al ſinful, according to preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, are not faithful. That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of Chriſt touching bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and loſing, except they bee well vnderſtood, bring much
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:2659:169"/> feare, or much preſumption That the binding and looſing by God is ſimply and plainly the principall. That prieſts doe onely heap vp thoſe things out of the ſcriptures, which ſerue for their bellies. That the Popes power, when he doth wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, is not to be feared. That an euil Pope is not the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of <hi>Peter,</hi> but of <hi>Iudas.</hi> That the Pope is the beaſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the Apocalipſe. This he denied to haue béen vttered by him. That it is lawfull to preach, notwithſtanding the Popes inhibition. That the Popes commandement béeing not agréeable to the Goſpel, is not to be obeyed. That the Cleargy and Laitie may iudge of the works of prelats. That God himſelfe doth ſuſpend euery wicked prieſt from his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery. That the Cleargie ſupplanteth the Laye people, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To theſe Articles aboue mentioned, were other alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, which the Pariſiens had ſet downe againſt him, to the number of <hi>19.</hi> The chiefe author wherof, was one <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> Chancellour of the Vniuerſitie of Paris, wherevnto hée had no time to anſwere.</p>
               <p>Now when the foreſaid articles were read, with their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, the cardinal of Cambray, with the reſt, exhorted <hi>Ioh.

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:2659:169"/> of the cloiſter, and brake vp the aſſembly for that time.</p>
               <p>The day before his condemnation, which was the ſixt of Iuly, the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> ſent vnto him foure Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, with M. <hi>Vincelat de Duba,</hi> and <hi>Iohn de Clum,</hi> to vnderſtand of him what he would doo, and when he was brought out to them, and his minde demaunded, he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his reſolution, that he was ready to be reformed if it could be prooued by the ſcriptures, that he had erred. Which the Biſhops counted an arrogant anſwere, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to be carried to priſon againe.</p>
               <p>The next day the Emperour with all the ſpirituall and temporall Lords, held a generall Seſſion in the head church of the city of Conſtance: in which <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> was diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, condemned, &amp; deliuered to the ciuil power.<note place="margin">

In the meane while, the B. of Lundy went vp and made a ſermon: when his ſermon was ended, the Procurer of the Councell riſing vp, named <hi>Henricus de Pyro,</hi> required that the proceſſe of the cauſe of <hi>Iohn Huſſe,</hi> might be continued, &amp; ſo procéed vnto the definitiue ſentence: then they alleadged other articles againſt him.

Afterward the article was read, how he appealed to Chriſt, and that by name was called hereticall.

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:2659:170"/> one of the iudges read the definitiue ſentence againſt him.</p>
               <p>When the ſentence and iudgement againſt him was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">

This his praier, the greater part, eſpecially of the Prieſts derided.</p>
               <p>At the laſt the <hi>7.</hi> biſhops diſgraded him, euery one taking a péece from him, &amp; when they came to the raſing of his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen crowne, before the Biſhops would go in hand with it, there fell a great contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among them, with what inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſhould be done, with a razor, or a paire of ſhieres.</p>

                  </note>In the meane ſeaſon, <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> turning toward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, ſaid, I maruel much that they being all of like cruell mind,<note place="margin">Cruelty of the biſhops againſt <hi>Huſſe.</hi>

Notwithſtanding at the laſt, they agreed to cut of the ſkin of his head, with a paire of ſhieres: which being done, they cauſed to be made a certaine crowne of paper, almoſt a cubite high: in the which were painted <hi>3.</hi> ougly diuels of a wonderfull ougly ſhape, and this title ſet ouer their heads. <hi>Hereſiarcha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The which when he ſaw, he ſaide, My Lord Ieſu Chriſt for my ſake did weare a crown of thorns, why ſhould not I then for his ſake againe, weare this light crowne, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo ignominious? Truely I will doe it, and that willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. When it was ſet vpon his head, the Biſhops ſaid, now we committe thy ſoule to the deuill. But I (ſaid <hi>Ioh.

So (after hee was committed to the Secular power,) the Emperor comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Ludouicus</hi> Duke of Bauaria, that he ſhould take <hi>Huſſe</hi> of the Biſhops hands, and deliuer him to thoſe that ſhoulde doe the execution.</p>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:2659:170"/>
               <p>The place appointed for his execution, was before the gate Gothebian betwéene the gardens, and gates of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes. When <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> was come thether, knéeling vpon his knées, and lifting his eyes vp to heauen, he prayed, and ſaid certaine Pſalmes, and ſpecially the <hi>51.</hi> and <hi>31.</hi> pſalmes: and they which ſtoode by, heard him oftentimes in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with a merie countenance, repeate this verſe: <hi>Vnto thy handes O Lord, I commend my ſpirite, &amp;c.</hi> Which thing when the Lay people behelde, which ſtoode next vnto him, they ſaid: what he hath done before we know not, but now we ſée, and heare, that hee prayeth very deuoutly, and godly.</p>
               <p>When as by the commandement of the tormentors hée was riſen vp from the place of his prayer, with a loud voice he ſaid: Lord Ieſu Chriſt, aſſiſt and helpe me, that with a conſtant and patient minde, by thy moſt gratious helpe, I may beare and ſuffer this cruell and ignominious death, whereunto I am condemned, for the preaching of thy moſt precious word, and holy Goſpel.</p>
               <p>So he was tied to a ſtake, toward the Weſt, becauſe (ſaid they) he was not worthie to looke towarde the Eaſt:<note place="margin">The behauiour of <hi>Huſſe</hi> at his death.</note> and ſtrawe, and fagots being put to him, <hi>Ludouicus</hi> Duke of Bauaria (before fire was put vnto the wood, with another with him, the ſonne of <hi>Clement</hi>) came, and exhorted him, that he would yet be mindfull of his ſafetie, and renounce his errors. To whom he ſaid, what errors ſhould I renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, when as I know my ſelfe guiltie of none. This was the principall ende, and purpoſe of my doctrine, that I might teach all men penance, and remiſſion of ſinnes, according to the veritie of the goſpell of Chriſt, and the expoſition of holie Doctors. Wherefore, with a cherefull mind and courage, I am here redy to ſuffer death.</p>
               <p>When he had ſpoken theſe words, they left him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſhaken hands, they departed. Then was the fire kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> began to ſing with a loude voice: Ieſu

               <p>Theſe were the pointes, obiected in the name of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Realme.

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:2659:185"/> ſhould come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> councel, wold not paſſe the Alpes: &amp; that he himſelf could not go ſo long a iourney, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Germanes in their own countrey,<note place="margin">Contention betwixt the P. and the fathers of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell.</note> would be ſo vntractable, that nothing could there be atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted for their reformation. Whervpon he cited the fathers of the councel vp to Bonony, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill. They againe cited the pope, that either he ſhould come himſelfe, or ſend his ambaſſadors, vnder great penaltie.</p>
               <p>For the appeaſing of this diſſention, the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Albert,</hi> king of the Romans, &amp; of the other princes of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, aſſembled together; firſt, at Norimberg, where they could determine nothing; and againe at Frankford, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the diſſention betwéen the Councel and the Pope. In the meane time, the Emperours Ambaſſadors, and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of the electors, went to Baſil, and conferring with the Ambaſſadours of other Princes, there they earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the fathers of the Councell, that they would tranſport the councel to another place (the which only thing pope <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> ſéemed alwaies to ſéeke and deſire) that either hée might therby deuide the fathers of the Councel, or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their liberties. Notwithſtanding, the Synode thought good, neither to deny the princes requeſt, neither graunt that which Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> deſired. During this doubt, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Embaſſadors, and the B. of Patauia, and Auguſta, (being much required therevnto) appointed a noble Baron, named <hi>Conrade Weinſperg,</hi> by the K. comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, to be the protector of the Councel, &amp; the fathers: but by means of a great peſtilence, which beganne to grow, the aſſembly that ſhould haue béen holden at Frankford, was tranſported vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mentz. The Ambaſſadors of the Princes thought good alſo to go thither, if by any meanes they might finde vnity. The aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly was very famous: for there were preſent, the Archb. of Mentz, Collen, and Treuers, electors of the ſacred empire: and al the Embaſſadors of the other Electors. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the Archb. of Collen was the chiefe fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Councel in this aſſembly. The ſacred Synode
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:2659:185"/> alſo thought good to ſend thether their Embaſſadour the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of Aquileia, the Biſhoppe of Venice, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Argen, diuines: <hi>Iohn Segonius,</hi> and <hi>Thomas de Corcellis,</hi> with diuerſe others. There was no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that would name himſelfe the Embaſſadour of <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> But the chiefe Hercules of the Eugenians was <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus Caſnanus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nicholaus Caſnanus.</note> a man ſingularly well learned, and of great experience.</p>
               <p>After diuerſe conſulatations had, the electors of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the Embaſſadours of the other Princes of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thought good, to giue forth commaundement through out their whole countrie and natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the decrées of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Baſill ſhould receiued and obſerued.</p>
               <p>While theſe thinges were thus debated at Mentz, there roſe vp a doubtful queſtion among the diuines, which remai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned at Baſil, whether <hi>Eugenius</hi> might be called an heritike, who ſo rebelliouſly contemned the commaundement of the Church. Among theſe diuines, the chiefeſt both in learning, and authoritie, was the Biſhop of Ebrium, Ambaſſadour to the king of Caſtile, and a certaine Scottiſh abbot: to whoſe reaſons, the reſt did conſent or giue place: and ſo <hi>Eugenius</hi> was pronounced both an heretike, and a relapſe.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eugenius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike &amp; relapſe</note> Eyght concluſions were there determined, and allowed amongſt them, which they called verities: the copie wherof they did diuulgate thorough al Chriſtendome.</p>
               <p>The verities were theſe. That the Councell hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie aboue the Pope. That the Pope cannot tranſport, nor proroge the general Councell, lawfully aſſembled,<note place="margin">8. Verities.</note> without the conſent of the whole. That he that reſiſteth thoſe veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is to be counted an heretike. That <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth had reſiſted thoſe verities. That <hi>Eugenius,</hi> being admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the ſacred Councel, did recant the errors repugnant to thoſe verities. That the diſſolution, or tranſlation of the Councell, attempted the ſecond time by <hi>Eugenius,</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the foreſaide verities. That <hi>Eugenius,</hi> in going
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:2659:186"/> about to diſſolue and tranſport the councell againe, is fallen into his firſt reuoked errours. That <hi>Eugenius</hi> beyng war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the councell to giue ouer, and notwithſtanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuering and erecting a councell at Ferraria, ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thereby obſtinate.</p>
               <p>When the Embaſſadors of the councell were returned from Mentz, and that certaine report was made of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of their decrées, the Fathers of the councell thought good to diſcuſſe the concluſions and verities of the diuines more at large: wherevpon by commaundement of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, all the Maiſters and Doctors of the clergie, with the reſidue of the Prelates, were called together into the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terhouſe of the great Church, there openly to diſpute and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe the hereſie of <hi>Eugenius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A diſputation of 6. daies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Pope <hi>Eugenius. Panormitane</hi> a defender of <hi>Eugenius.</hi>
                  </note>This diſputation continued <hi>6.</hi> daies, both forenoone, and after noone. Among whom, Cardinall <hi>Ludouicus</hi> Archb. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relatenſis</hi> was the iudge of the whole diſputation. They co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded according to the former verities, and all in a maner allowed them, except <hi>Panormitane,</hi> Archbiſhop, who much diſputed againſt them. Likewiſe did the biſhop of Burgen, the king of <hi>Aragons</hi> Almoner: yet did they not gainſay the <hi>3.</hi> firſt concluſions, but only thoſe wherein Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> was touched. <hi>Panormitane</hi> greatly contending with the B. of Argens, <hi>Iohn Segonius,</hi> and <hi>Francis de Felix,</hi> Diuines that <hi>Eugenius</hi> was not relapſed, wrought ſo, that the worde Relapſe, was taken out of the Concluſions, and in ſteade thereof, the word Prolapſe put in. Neither durſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normitane</hi> himſelfe altogether excuſe <hi>Eugenius</hi> of hereſie, but defended more the firſt reſolution, than the ſecond: yet departed he not without anſwere, for <hi>Iohn Segonius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I. Segonius.</note> an expert Diuine, fullie anſwered him, and ſcarſe could finiſh his oration without interruption: for, <hi>Panormitane</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times interrupting him, went about (diſorderly) to confute, now this, and now that reaſon.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, the B. of Argen interrupted <hi>Panormitan,</hi>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:2659:186"/> in his arguments, and put him from his purpoſe. Yet they paſſed ſo farre, that that they did not abſtain from opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous taunts: &amp; when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> B. of Argen ſaid, that the pope ought to be the miniſter of the Church, <hi>Panormitan</hi> could not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that, but ſo farre forgat himſelfe, that he ſaide, the Pope was Lord ouer the Church. <hi>Segonius,</hi> on the contrary part,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Panormitane</hi> wil haue the P. Lord of the Church. Seruant of ſeruants, the P. honorableſt title.</note> anſwered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt honorable title the P. had, to bée called the ſeruant of the ſeruants of God: and alleaged why they ought not to ſéeke after forraine Lordſhippe, becauſe Chriſt himſelfe came not to be miniſtred vnto, but to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, &amp;c. With whoſe anſweres, he being ſomewhat diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Councel brake vp, and departed.</p>
               <p>The next day after dinner, they returned all againe, where the Archb. of Lions, the Kings Orator, requeſted to ſpeake his minde. After he had by diuers reaſons prooued <hi>Eugenius</hi> to be an Heretike, he bitterly complayned, dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting the negligence, and ſlouthfulneſſe of thoſe, which had preferred ſuch a man to the Papacie: and ſo moued all their hearts that were preſent, that they al with him,<note place="margin">The Councel aboue the P.</note> did bewaile the calamitie of the vniuerſal church.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of Bruxels, Ambaſſador for the King of Spaine, did excellently proue, that the Councell was aboue the Pope: yet doubted hee whether they were verities of faith. The K. of Arragons Almoſiner (being a craftie, and ſubtile man) did not directly diſpute vpon the concluſions, but picking out here and there, certaine arguments, ſought to hinder the Councell: againſt whom, an Abbot of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and <hi>Tho. de Corcellis,</hi> did largely diſpute in defence of the Concluſions.</p>
               <p>When the Diſputation was ended, and a finall conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe matters euen at hand, the Archbiſhops of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, and Panormitane, armed themſelues to let the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and exhorted all men of their faction, to withſtande it. And firſt of all, as ſoone as the congregation was aſſembled, the Biſhop of Burgen exhorted them to deferre the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:2659:187"/> and to tarie for the Ambaſſadors of other Princes, who would ſhortly returne from Mentz.</p>
               <p>After him <hi>Panormitane</hi> ſpake alſo to the ſame end, and ſo did <hi>Ludouicus</hi> the Prothonotarie of Rome. But <hi>Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicus,</hi> the Cardinall <hi>Arelatenſis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ludouicus.</hi> Cardinal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relatenſis.</note> made an eloquent, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Oration; and perſwaded them to conſtancie, and to the maintenance of the concluſions.</p>
               <p>And when he had made an end of his Oration there was a great noiſe, crying out, and brauling euery where. Which when <hi>Ludouicus</hi> the Patriarche of Aquileia perceiued, hee ſaide vnto <hi>Panormitane,</hi> and vnto <hi>Ludouicus</hi> Prothono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie: doe not thinke the matter ſhall ſo paſſe, you knowe not yet the manners of the Germanes: for if you goe foorth on this faſhion, it will not be lawfull for you to departe out of this countrey with whole heads.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Iohn,</hi> Earle of Dierſten, (who then ſupplyed the Protectors place) and the Citizens of Baſill, gaue aſſurance of ſafetie, and the Earle willed them to bee of good cheare: who, neuer diſcouraged at the Patriarches wordes, and by an Interpretor declared, that his minde was not to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but to nouriſh the Fathers: they ſhould foreſée, that they ſhould not depart from the councel, nothing being done, and furthermore, deſired pardon, if his wordes had offended the Councel, <hi>Panormitane,</hi> or any man. Yet for al this the noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and cries, could not be ſtayed: for, as often as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made of reading the <hi>Concordatum,</hi> great noyſe, and rumors were ſtill made to ſtoppe the ſame: ſo that <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus</hi> Archbiſhop of Lyons, and Primate of all Fraunce, a man of great reuerence and authority, was moued to ſpeake in the behalfe of the Concluſions, and to admoniſh them, not to geue eare vnto the diſturbers of concord. In the end, the <hi>Concordatum</hi> of the xij. men, concerning the articles, were required to bee read by the Cardinall <hi>Arelatenſis,</hi> many whiſpering him in the eare, that he ſhould goe forward, and not alter his purpoſe.</p>
               <pb n="367" facs="tcp:2659:187"/>
               <p>Then <hi>Panormitane,</hi> aſſoone as the concordatum began to be read, riſing vp with his companions, &amp; the Aragons, cried out with a lowde voice, ſaying: you Fathers do contemne our requeſts, &amp; deſpiſe prelates: you would conclude, but it is not your part to conclude: we are the greater part of the prelates: we make the councell, and it is our part to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. And I in the name of the reſt do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that this is to be deferred and delayed. With this word there ſprang ſuch a noiſe and rumour in the councell,<note place="margin">Great diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the councell.</note> as is accuſtomed to be in battle when two armies ioyne: ſome curſing that which <hi>Panormitane</hi> went about: other ſome allowing the ſame.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Nicholas Amici,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nicholas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mici.</note> a diuine of Paris, according vnto his office, ſaid: <hi>Panormitane,</hi> I appeale from this your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, to the iudgement of the Councel here preſent, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I affirme any thing ratified, which you haue done, as I am redy to proue, if it ſhall ſéem good. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary part ſéemed now in better place, for they had already concluded. The other part, neither had concluded, neither was it ſéene how they could conclude among ſo great cries and vprores. Notwithſtanding, amongſt all theſe troublous noyſes, <hi>Ioh. Sigonius,</hi> a ſingular diuine, of the Vniuerſitie of Salamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, had audience, and reproued <hi>Panormitane,</hi> in that hée had concluded, without deciding of the Deputies, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination of twelue men, or any rite, or order: and ſo procéeded to exhort them to conſtancie, &amp; not to depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finall concluſion.</p>
               <p>In the meane time,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Panormitan</hi> is obſtinate.</note> many graue men exhorted <hi>Panormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,</hi> to geue ouer his concluſion: but neither was he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo to doe, nor the Fathers determined to depart without a concluſion. All things were diſturbed, neither did the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates ſit in their ſeates: but as affection led them, ſome went to the Cardinall <hi>Arelatenſis,</hi> ſome to <hi>Panormitane.</hi> Then <hi>Arelatenſis</hi> ſéeing the matter to be in danger, and that there was no readie way to make a concluſion, thought to vſe ſome policie to appeaſe the multitude: and tolde them all,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:2659:188"/> he had newes to declare them,<note place="margin">A policie of <hi>Arelatenſis.</hi>
                  </note> wherewith they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous attentiue, and kept great ſilence. <hi>Eugenius</hi> meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (ſaith he) hath filled all Fraunce, preaching a new doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, extolling the authoritie of the Biſhop of Rome aboue the ſacred councell, and therefore the Councell muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie prouide remedy: and to conclude, at the leaſt vppon the three firſt verities, which the Fathers had doone, euen as I alſo (ſaith he) doo here conclude, in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne, and Holy ghoſt. And when he had finiſhed his oration,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arelatenſis</hi> concludeth.</note> with a chéerefull and mery countenance, riſing vp he departed: ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kiſſed him, ſome of them kiſſed the ſkirtes of his garments, and commended his wiſedome.</p>
               <p>It is reported, that <hi>Panormitane,</hi> when he came to his lodging, and was gone to his chamber, complained with teares, that hee had both wittingly and willingly impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the trueth.</p>
               <p>After this, there was a great conſultation among the Eugenians, what was beſt to doe in this matter. Some thought to leaue the Councel, other ſome to tarry, &amp; to reſiſt, that nothing ſhould farther be done againſt <hi>Eugenius:</hi> and this opinion remained among them.</p>
               <p>The next day after, being the <hi>25.</hi> of Aprill, the Archb. of Lyons, and the Biſhoppe of Burgen calling together the Prelates into the Chapter houſe of the great Church, began many things as touching peace. The Biſhop of Burgen perſwaded, that there ſhould be deputations appointed that day, vnto whom, the Archbiſhop of Lions ſhould geue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to make an agréement. Vnto whom it was ſaid, there could be no agréeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, before the aduerſaries confeſſed their fault, and deſired pardon therefore. Anon after, the Fathers of the Councel had drawen out a forme of a decrée vpon the former concluſions, and had approued the ſame in the ſacred deputations. By this time the Princes Orators were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the aſſemblie at Mentz: and holding a Councel among them ſelues, they had determined to let the decrée.</p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:2659:188"/>
               <p>The <hi>9.</hi> day of May, there was a generall conuocation holden, wherevnto all men reſorted. The princes Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors were called by the B. of Lubecke, &amp; <hi>Conrade de Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperg</hi> the proctor, into the quire, and there kept: where they tarried ſo long, that (the forme of the decree beyng appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be concluded that day) the Cardinall perceiuing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation to be full, and that the twelue men had agréed, and that there was great expectation with ſilence, thought good not to delay it for feare of tumult, but commaunded by and by the publike Concordances to be read. Wherein this was alſo contained, that the Cardinall <hi>Arelatenſis</hi> might appoint a Seſſion, whenſoeuer he would: which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing read, and beyng deſired by the promoters, concluded as the manner and cuſtome is.</p>
               <p>Whereof when the Princes Embaſſadors which were in the quire vnderſtood, they brake of their talke, and beyng much vexed, they imputed all to the B. of Lubecke,<note place="margin">The Biſhop of Lubecke.</note> which of purpoſe had kept them in the quire, and protracted the time. Wherevpon they entring into the congregation, filled the houſe full of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints, &amp; greatly blamed <hi>Arelatenſis:</hi> which diuerſe others did alſo, eſpecially the biſhop of Millane, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon him, calling him another Catiline, vnto whom all deſperate and naughty perſons had refuge.</p>
               <p>To whom after <hi>Arelatenſis</hi> had made anſwere, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the forme of the decree to be read. Then <hi>Panor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitane</hi> and thoſe that were of his part, would needes haue a certaine proteſtation firſt to be read. There was great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention on euery ſide: notwithſtanding, at the laſt, <hi>Arela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſis</hi> preuailed, and the forme of the decrée was read vnto this word <hi>Decernimus,</hi> that is, we decrée. Then <hi>Panor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitane</hi> riſing vp, would not ſuffer it to be read any further, and the Biſhop of Patauia ſaid, that it was vncomely, that <hi>Arelatenſis</hi> with a few Biſhops by name, ſhould conclude the matter: the like did alſo all they that fauoured <hi>Panor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitane.</hi> The Cardinall of Terraconia alſo did grieuouſly
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:2659:189"/> rebuke his partakers, that they did not reade the proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and commaunded one of his familiars to read it. But the fathers of the Councell would not giue place to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the proteſtation. Which when <hi>Albingane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſis</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, hée commaunded the writing to be giuen vnto him, and as he began to ſpeake, ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly <hi>Arelatenſis</hi> roſe vp, with a great number of the Fathers to depart: but by the means of <hi>George</hi> the Prothonotary of Bardaxina, the multitude which were departing, were called backe againe, and the Cardinall and the Patriarch were required to ſit downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and that they ſhould not leaue the church void &amp; quiet for the aduerſaries: wherevpon ſuddenly all the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude ſat downe, and the gates were ſhut againe.</p>
               <p>In the meane time <hi>Matthaeus Albinganenſis</hi> a B. read the proteſtation, to none elſe but to himſelfe alone, for it could not be heard for noiſe: which being ended, the Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards and Cathelans confirmed the proteſtation: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by reaſon the Cardinall of Terraconia ſaid, he agréed to that diſſention, becauſe the Embaſſadors of his king diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented from them, with him almoſt all the Arragons, Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, &amp; Cathelans departed: all the other taried ſtill. So <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relatenſis</hi> ſeing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation quiet, willed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſions &amp; forme of the decrée to be read againe (There remained in the congregation the Embaſſadours of the Empyre, and of France, talking together of their affaires) Notwithſtanding the B. of Turnon heard mention made of the concluſions, &amp; turning himſelfe to the B. of Lubecke, ſaid: Lo the matters of faith are now in hand againe, let vs go hence I pray you, that we be not offence to others, or that we be not ſaid to diſſent from the Embaſſadors: the B. of Lubecke anſwered tary father,<note place="margin">The Biſhop of Lubecke fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the truth.</note> tary here: are not the concluſions moſt true? why, are you afraid to be here for the truth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arelatenſis</hi> after all things were read, which he thought neceſſarie, at the requeſt of the deputies concluded: and ſo making an end, diſmiſſed the congregation.</p>

               <p>After this, it was determined betwéene the Lombards, &amp; Arragons, to abſtaine from the deputations for a certayne time. Which they did not long obſerue: notwithſtanding the deputations were holden very quietly for a certaine ſpace, neither was there any thing done worthy of remembrance, vntill the <hi>15.</hi> day of May. During which time, al means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible was ſought to ſet a concord betwixt the fathers, but it would not be. Then <hi>Nicholas Amici</hi> required <hi>Arelatenſis,</hi> to appoint a Seſſion againſt the morrow after: which he did according to his motion. The B. of Lubecke made proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his owne name, and in the name of his protector, that he would not conſent, that there ſhould be any ſeſſion, if it ſhould in any part derogate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the agréement had at Mentz. <hi>George Miles</hi> alſo, his fellow Ambaſſador, conſented to this proteſtation: but the protector of the Councell would in no caſe conſent vnto the proteſtation of the B. of Lubecke, and ſaide, that hee did not know any thing of their doinges at Mentz.</p>
               <p>After the other, the Biſhop of Concenſe made his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, and after him followed <hi>Panormitane,</hi> who reproued the promoter of the faith, becauſe he required the prelates to haue a ſeſſion, and inſtantly required, there might be no ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſon as yet holden.</p>
               <p>Vnto whom, <hi>Arelatenſis</hi> anſwered: that the promoter of the faith,<note place="margin">The promoter of the faith.</note> ought by his office to call the prelates to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine a matter of faith; eſpecially, for ſo much as the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the faith and the whole Councell had ſo giuen him in commaundement: and further, confuted <hi>Panormitane,</hi> and required him to conſider, in this ſtanding for <hi>Eugenius,</hi> whether he ſpake according to his conſcience, or not: for (ſaith he) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which now ſhalbe decréed, are moſt general, neither is there any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion in them of the pope, &amp; moreouer, the veritie of faith is contained in them, againſt the which, if <hi>Eugenius</hi> did contend, it were more méete, that the pope ſhould be corrected, then the veritie omitted. And thus hée
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:2659:190"/> making an end, all were warned to come the next day to the Seſſion.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>16.</hi> day of May was come, all they whom the Seſſion pleaſed, aſſembled at the houre: the Ambaſſadors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the princes were come together into the Church quire, to attempt further what they could doe: and ſending the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Lubeck, and Concenſe, and the Deane of Turnon, an excellent learned learned man, they offered themſelues to be preſent at the Seſſion, if the depoſition of <hi>Eugenius</hi> might be deferred yet <hi>4.</hi> moneths: who when they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle anſwere of <hi>Arelatenſis,</hi> and the other principals, returning againe, the Ambaſſadours would haue onely the firſt concluſion decréed: and therevpon ſent againe vnto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relatenſis,</hi> vnto whom anſwere was made, that the chiefe force did conſiſt in the two other concluſions,, and that the Councell would ſpecially determine vpon them: with which anſwere they departed, and the Seſſion began to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, and <hi>Arelatenſis</hi> cauſed prayers and lamentations to be made,<note place="margin">Praiers with teares.</note> with lamentations and teares, that God would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them.

Yet, <hi>Arelatenſis</hi> would not depart, but kept conſtant, and helde out the Councel. And after that the time of the decrée was paſſed, and <hi>Gabriel</hi> depoſed, the Fathers procéeded to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of another P. And firſt of all, they nominated thoſe that (together with the Cardinals) ſhould elect the Pope.</p>
               <p>The firſt, and principall of the Electors, was Cardinal <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relatenſis:</hi> the reſt of the Electors were choſen out of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian, French, Germaine, and Spaniſh Nations.</p>
               <p>The next day after there was a Seſſion holden, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Marcus,</hi> a famous Diuine, made an Oration, and recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp the manifolde vices of <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and deſcribed what kinde of man he ought to be that ſhould ſuccéede: euen one quite contrarie vnto him in all reſpects.

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:2659:191"/> like manner, all the other Electors did take their oath: then they went with great ſolemnitie vnto their conclaue, where they remayned ſeuen dayes.</p>
               <p>The manner of their election was on this ſort. Before the Cardinals ſeate was ſet a deſke, wherein there ſtoode a Baſon of ſiluer.<note place="margin">The manner of electing the pope.</note> Into the which Baſon, all the Electors did caſt their Schedules: which the Cardinall receiuing, read one by one, and foure other of the Electors wrote as he did reade them.</p>

               <p>

Euery one of the Electors ſubſcribed his name vnto the Schedule, that he might thereby know his owne, and ſay nay, if it were contrarie to that which was ſpoken: whereby all deceit was vtterly excluded.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſcrutinie thus ended, <hi>17.</hi> of diuers nations were nominated: notwithſtanding, <hi>Amideus,</hi> D. of Sauoy (who had béene married, a man of ſingular vertue) ſurmounted them all: for in the firſt ſcrutinie he had the voice of <hi>16.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors. In the next ſcrutinie, which was holden in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nones of Nouember, he had <hi>21.</hi> voices, and ſo likewiſe in the <hi>3.</hi> and <hi>4.</hi> ſcrutinies. And foraſmuch as there was none in all the ſcrutinie, found to haue two partes, all the other Schedules were burnt. And, becauſe there lacked but one voice to the election of the high B. they fell to prayer, deſiring God, that he would direct their mindes to the vnitie of the Church.</p>

               <p>Then the Cardinall Arelatenſis publiſhed vnto them the name of the elect Biſhop. After this, they gaue thanks in the great Church, and declared the election again to the people, and hauing ſong an himne, departed.</p>
               <p>

               <p>About the beginning of October, <hi>M. Luther</hi> came to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta, at the charges of the prince Elector, and hauing obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſafeconduct from the Emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> preſented

               <p>After this, <hi>Luther</hi> prepareth an anſwere by and by to <hi>Caietanus,</hi> teaching that the merites of Chriſt are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to men: that the Pope may erre: that hée ought to bee reprehended: that authoritie of Scriptures ought to leade in matters of faith: that the extrauagant containeth vntrueths, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Cardinall woulde heare no Scripture, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded <hi>Luther</hi> to come no more in his preſence, except hée woulde recant: yet <hi>Luther</hi> abode there ſtill, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not.</p>
               <p>The Cardinall ſent for <hi>Iohannes Stupitius,</hi> Vicar of the Auguſtines, and mooued him earneſtly to bring <hi>Luther</hi> to recant of his owne accord. <hi>Luther</hi> tarried two daies after, and nothing was ſaide vnto him:<note place="margin">

               <p>This wryting the Cardinall lightly regarded.

               <p>After <hi>Luthers</hi> departure, the Cardinall writeth a ſharp letter vnto duke <hi>Fredericke,</hi> declaring the dangerous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Luther,</hi> and exhorteth the Duke to tender his owne honour and ſafetie, and to expell <hi>Luther</hi> out of his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

This doone, the Duke ſendeth the letter of the Cardinall to <hi>Luther: Luther</hi> writeth again to the duke, and declareth how he was dealt with at Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta, what he offered, and how he attended, offering alſo him ſelfe to baniſhment, to auoyde the malice of his enimies: &amp; no doubt, both the Duke and <hi>Luther</hi> were brought into a ſtreight. In which meane time, the Vniuerſity of Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg wrote their letters in defence of <hi>Luther,</hi> which cauſed the Duke now ſeriouſly to hearken to his cauſe.

               <p>

In which hée confeſſed hée might haue dealt, not with ſuch vehemencie of ſpirit, yet that

               <p>Theſe wordes thus pronounced, <hi>Eckius</hi> the Emperours prolocutor, with a ſterne countenance, refuſed his anſwere, as not direct, and plaine. Then <hi>Luther,</hi> conſidering (ſaith hée) your ſoueraigne maieſtie, and your Honours require a plaine anſwere: this I ſay, and profeſſe as reſolutely as I may, without doubting, or ſophiſtication, that if I bee not conuicted by teſtimonie of the Scriptures, and by probable reaſons, (for I beléeue not the Pope, nor gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels, which haue erred many times, and haue béen contrary to themſelues) my conſcience is ſo bound and captiued in theſe Scriptures, and worde of God, which I haue alleadged, that I may not, <note place="margin">

That done, (through the councel of ſome, which knew the cowardly hearts of the multitude) order was taken, that the men which had weapons, ſhoulde venture through the preſſe, onely the women and children, remained in the houſe, &amp; a few men with them, which were leſſe bolde, to the number of ſixe or ſeuen ſcore: where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the wonderful work of God, in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> went out with weapons: which (notwithſtanding, that the lanes and paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were ſtopped,<note place="margin">A maruellous deliuerance.</note> and fires made) did all eſcape, ſaue onely one, who was beaten downe with ſtones, and ſo deſtroied.

The women, who were all of great wealth, only ſixe or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen excepted, perceyuing the furie of the people, wente vp to the windowes, crying mercie, ſhewing their innocent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent required iuſtice ordinarie.</p>

The brethren which eſcaped, hearing this, conſulted, firſt to humble themſelues with praier before God in their priuate families. Secondly, to ſtop the brutes running of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, to write Apologies, one to the king,<note place="margin">An Apologie to the king.</note> another to the people. The Apologie to the king nothing preuailed: who was perſwaded that all was but pretenced excuſes.

                  <p>The Archbiſhop of Arles, the Biſhop of Aix, &amp; diuers Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, and Priors, conſulted how to execute the arreſt with all ſpéede, and by the aduice of the Biſhop of Aix they went to Auinion, there with other Prelates to intreat of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: in which aſſembly they made a generall compoſition, confirmed with an oth, that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould endeuor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that the arreſt of Merindoll ſhould be executed with al expedition, euery man offering to furniſh out men of warre according to his ability, the charge wherof was giuen to the B. of Aix.

                  </p>
                  <p>About this time, the yéere 1542. the vicelegate of <hi>Auini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> aſſembled a great number of men of war, at the requeſt of the B. of Cauailon, to deſtroy <hi>Cabriers:</hi>

                  <p>Afterward, it was ordained by the court of Parlement, that according to the kings letters, <hi>Ioh. Durand,</hi> counſeller of the court of parlement, with a ſecretary, and the Biſh. of
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:2659:246"/> Cauaillon, with a Doctor of diuinitie, ſhould goe vnto Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindoll, and there declare vnto the Inhabitants, the hereſies which they knew to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion: &amp; to make them apparant by good and ſufficient information.

                  <p>Whereupon, <hi>Durandus</hi> ſignified the day that he woulde be preſent at Merindol, that none of the Inhabitants might be abſent. At the day appointed, the parties aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned came vnto Merindoll, whereas alſo were preſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Gentlemen, and men of vnderſtanding of all ſortes. There was called foorth <hi>Anthonie Mailard,</hi>

Many that came thether to heare this diſputation, were much touched, and moued to require copies of their confeſſion, and anſweres. Whereupon, many were conuerted to the faith: &amp; namelie, 3. doctors, who went about to diſſwade the Merindolians from the trueth: whoſe miniſterie God vſed afterwarde in the preaching of the Goſpel. Of whom, one was D. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> Prior of S.

                  <pb n="486" facs="tcp:2659:247"/>
                  <p>After this, the Inhabitantes of Merindoll were in quiet for a time, vntill <hi>Iohn Miniers,</hi> an excéeding bloudy tirant, began a new perſecution.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Miniers,</hi> being Lord of Opedie, néere to Merindol, firſt began to vexe the poore Chriſtians, by polling and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, getting from them what he could, to inlarge his own Lordſhippe, which before was very baſe. For this cauſe, he put 5. or 6. of his owne Tenants into a Ciſtern vnder the ground and cloaſing it vp, there kept them till they died for hunger, (prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that they wer Lutherans) to haue their goods and poſſeſſions.</p>

By which lie he obteined the kings letters patentes, and through the helpe of the Cardinal of Tournon, commanded the ſentence of the former arreſt to be executed againſt the Merindolia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>
                  <p>After this, he gathered all the Kings armie, which was then in Prouence, ready to go againſt the Engliſhmen: and tooke vp all (beſides) that were redy to beare armour in the chéefe townes of Prouence: and ioyned them with the army which the popes Legate had leuied for that purpoſe in Aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and all the Countrey of Venice, and employed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame to the deſtruction of Merindoll and Cabriers, and of other Townes and Villages, to the number of 22. geuing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Souldiers, to ſpoile, ranſacke, burn, &amp; deſtroy al together, and to kil man, woman, &amp; child, without al pity, ſparing none.

                  <p>The Merindolians ſéeing all on a flaming fire about them, left their houſes, with women and children, and other few, and with them certaine miniſters of their Churches. <hi>Miniers</hi> in the meane time, had deuided his army into two parts, marching with the one partie himſelfe towards Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindoll: and hauing knowledge by eſpiall, whether the Merindolians were fledde, hée ſent the other part of his armie to ſet vppon them on a ſudden: who came and found them aſſembled at prayers, and ſpoyled them of all that they, had pulling their garmentes from their backes:<note place="margin">Popiſh cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie.</note> ſome they rauiſhed, ſome they whipped and ſcourged, ſome they ſold away like cattle, &amp;c.

That doone, this tyrant commaunded captain <hi>Iohn de Guy,</hi> with a band of ruffians to go into the church (wher was a great number of women, children, and yoong infants) to kill all that he found there: he although at firſt refuſing, yet being threatned, performed the ſame.

                  <p>In token of this ioly victory, the Popes officers cauſed a piller to be erected in the place of Cabriers, in which was engrauen the yeare and daye of ſackyng the towne by <hi>Iohn Miniers</hi> Lord of Oped, and chéefe preſident of the Parlement of Prouence.

Theſe articles returned to the Kings court, where they remained a whole yéere without any anſwere made: during which time they of the valleys liued in great quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: whereby the number of the faithfull ſo increaſed, that throughout the valleies, Gods word was truely preached, and his ſacraments duly adminiſtred, and no maſſe ſaide in Angroign, nor in diuers places.</p>
                  <p>The yere following, the preſident of S. <hi>Iulian</hi> returned with his aſſociates, to Pigneroll, &amp; ſent for thither the chief rulers of Angroign, and of the valley of Lucerne: that is, for 6. of Angroign, &amp; for two of euery pariſh beſide: ſaying vnto them, that their confeſſion was found to be heretical: &amp; that therfore the K. commanded them to returne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obedience of the church of Rome, vnder paine of loſſe, both of life, &amp; goods: enioyning them moreouer, to giue him anſwere within 3. daies: from thence he went to the vallie of Lucern, &amp; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them greatly.

                  <p>At the ſame time, a Miniſter of Angroign, named <hi>Gef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey Variala,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Geffrey Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ala.</note> was taken at Berge, going to viſite thoſe

                  <p>A few daies after, a miniſter of the valley of Luſerne was taken priſoner at Suſe, and ſoone after ſent to Turin, where he was condemned to be burnt, but the hangman at the time of the execution, fained himſelfe ſicke, and conueied himſelfe away, and ſo did another ſerue them, wherevpon the miniſter was committed againe to priſon, where after long and painefull endurance, ſeing the priſon dore open, he eſcaped and returned to his cure.</p>
                  <p>Now foure yéeres being paſt, <hi>Anno 1559.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1559"/> there was a peace concluded, betwéene the French king and the king of Spaine: wherevpon, the countrie of Piedmount, certain towns excepted, were reſtored to the Duke of Sauoy: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe regiment, the foreſaid Churches, and all other faithfull people of Piedmont continued in great quietneſſe: the Duke himſelf being contented they ſhould vſe their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer religion. But the Pope and his Cardinals coulde not beare it, and the popes Legat, who followed the Court, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Duke by all meanes, not to ſuffer this people: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people foreſéeing their danger, wrote to the Duke with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent, ſhewing, that the cauſe why they were ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was their religion: which they deſired to be tried by the word of God: but it is not certaine, whether this aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were deliuered to the Duke or not: for, in the moneth of March following, there was great perſecution rayſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the poor Chriſtians which were at Carignon: among whom, there were certaine godly perſons, taken, &amp; burnt within 4. dayes after:<note place="margin">Perſecution.</note> that is to ſay, one <hi>Mathurine</hi> and his wife, and <hi>Iohn de Carquignan,</hi> dwelling in the Valley of Lucern, taken priſoner as he went to the market of Pigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll. Many at that time fled away: others fearing the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, returned to the church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>Within few dayes after, the Churches of Lelarch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roun, Meane, and Suſe, were woonderfully aſſaulted. The
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:2659:250"/> miniſter of Suſe, and Mean, among others were taken, who was put to death in the fire. Of Larch and Meroun, ſome were ſent to the galleyes, other ſome yealded,<note place="margin">Thoſe that yelded, more cruelly handled then thoſe that were conſtant.</note> and ſome fled away. It is certainly knowen, that ſuch as yelded were more cruelly handled than they that continued conſtant.</p>
                  <p>The beginning of this horrible perſecution, roſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations made in al places, that none ſhould reſort to the ſermons of the Lutherans, but ſhould liue after the cuſtome of Rome, vpon paine of the forfeyture of their goods, and to be condemned to the Gallies for euer, or to loſe their liues. Thrée of the moſt cruell perſons that could be found, were appointed to execute this commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, was one <hi>Thomas Iaconel,</hi> a Sodomite, and a monſter againſt God and nature. He was a Monke, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor of the Romiſh faith, and a falſe Apoſtata.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond was <hi>Collaterall Corbis,</hi> who (after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſals of going to maſſe) vſed to burne them within 3. daies. But it is certainly reported, that ſéeing the conſtancie, and hearing the confeſſion of the poor martirs (féeling a remorſe and torment in his conſcience) he gaue ouer, and proteſted he would meddle no more. The 3. was the Prouoſt <hi>de la Iuſtice,</hi> a cruel, and crafty wretch.</p>
                  <p>In that ſeaſon, one named <hi>Charles de Comptes,</hi> of the Valley of Luſerne, and one of the Lords of Angroigne, did write vnto the Commiſſioners, that they ſhoulde vſe ſome lenitie towardes them of the Valley of Luſerne: by reaſon whereof, they were a while more gently entreated then the reſt: but the Monkes of Pigneroll, with certaine ruffians about them, did torment, and burne, and ſent to the gallies, ſuch as were of the churches néere vnto them.</p>
                  <p>The gentlemen of the Valley of S. Martin, intreated their tenants very roughly, commaunding them to returne to the maſſe: and aboue the reſt, two ſpecially, <hi>Charles Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet,</hi> and <hi>Boniface</hi> his brother: who the 2. of Aprill before day, (with a number of Ruffians) ſpoyled a village of their
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:2659:251"/> Subiects, called <hi>Reuclaret,</hi> and certaine of the retinue tooke a Miniſter of the ſame valley priſoner, which was come out of Calabria, and was going to viſite the poore people of Reuclaret, and led him priſoner to the Abbey, where, not long after, he was burnt, with another of the Valley of S. Martin. The 3. night after, they of Pragella, ſent about 400 to diſcomfite the companie of the Trouchettes, &amp; to reſtore thoſe that were fled, to their houſes: which they did, putting them to flight, with the only loſſe of one man.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Charles Trouchet</hi> and his brother, did ſo incenſe the Duke againſt the poore people, with falſe reportes, that they perſwaded the Duke to builde fortreſſes in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and to place gariſons. The people withſtood the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, and ſent certaine to the Duke: and immediatlie after, the Commiſſioners ſent alſo to the D. Court, being at Nice, to inflame his anger more againſt them. But God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ordeyned: for, the <hi>Trouchets</hi> being at Nice, went to ſea with diuers noble men: and immediatly were taken priſoners by the Turkes, put into the gallies, ſore beaten w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ropes: &amp; long time after (denying their nobilitie) were ſent home hauing paid 400. crowns for their ranſom. Some ſay, that the D. himſelf was almoſt taken, but ſure it is, that hée fel ſick ſoone after.</p>
                  <p>In April next following, by meanes of the L. of Raconis, who was preſent at a ſermon néer Angroign, they put vp 3 ſupplications, one to the D. another to the duches, the 3. to D. councel: wherin were debated the points of their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: they offering to reforme what was the wed by Gods word to bee amiſſe. After this, the perſecution ſéemed to be ſtaied for a litle while. In Iune next following, the L. <hi>Raconis,</hi> &amp; the L. of Trinity, came to Angroign, to perſwade the people to put away their preachers, &amp; to receaue the maſſe: which if they would doe, they promiſed to pacifie the D. and to be a meanes to ſtay the perſecution? but the people refuſed ſo to do. Wherupon, exclamations were made, &amp; perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> began
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:2659:251"/> to be more furious on euery ſide: amongſt others the monks of Pigneroll were moſt cruell,<note place="margin">Cruel Monks.</note> who ſent out a company of hired Ruffians, that ſpoiled all they could lay hold on, &amp; led away men, women, and children, captiues to the Abbey, where they were moſt pittifully tormented.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, alſo they ſent a band of the fame Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians by night to the miniſters houſe of S. Germaine, in the valley of Perouſe, where they tooke him, and ſore wounded him, and pricked him behind with their halbards, to make him haſten his pace: at that time alſo many they ſlue, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they hurt, and many they brought to the Abbey, and there kept them in priſon, &amp; cruelly handled them. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, after long impriſonment, they roſted at a ſmall fire:<note place="margin">The miniſter roſted.</note> when half his body was burnt, he confeſſed, and cried on the Lord Ieſus with a loude voice. Now, foraſmuch as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery was great, and theſe ruffians, to the number of 300. had made great ſpoyle, that no man coulde dwell there in ſafetie: it was dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſters, whether it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for men to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt theſe ruffians, or no: the miniſters anſwered, it was lawful: warning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any caſe, to take héed of bloodſhedding. This queſtion being once diſſolued, they of the valley of Luſerne, and Angroign, ſent certaine men to them of S <hi>Germane</hi> to ayd them againſt the ſupports of theſe monkes.</p>
                  <p>In the moneth of Iuly, they of Angroign being in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at harueſt, vpon the hill ſide of S. Germain, perceiued a company of ſouldiers ſpoyling them of S. Germain, and doubting they would goe to Angroign, made an outcry. The people of Angroign aſſembled themſelues vpon the hill and ſome ran to S. Germain, ouer the hill, &amp; ſome by the valley. They y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> went by the valley met the ruffians comming from S. Germ. laden w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſpoile which they had gotten: &amp; being but 50. ſet vpon 20. wel appointed, &amp; gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ouerthrow. Then paſſing ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bridge, being ſtopped, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies were faine to take the riuer of Cluzon, where diuers were ſlaine:
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:2659:252"/> many drowned, and ſome eſcaped very hardly, and ſuch a ſlaughter was made of them, that the riuer was died with the bloud of them that were wounded and ſlaine, but none of the Angrognians were once hurt: if the riuer had béen as great as it was woont commonly to be, there had not one man eſcaped aliue.</p>
                  <p>The next day following, the commaunder of S. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny de Foſſeaw</hi> came to Angroigne, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with diuers gentlemen, ſaying: he was ſent by the duke, commanding them to put away their miniſters: which they refuſed to doo. From thence he went to the abbay of Pignorell, where hée and <hi>Iaconiell</hi> cauſed a number of the poore inhabitants of Campillon: and of Feuill, which be of the valley of Luſern, to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priſoners: ſpoyling them of their goods; driuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their cattle, and forcing them to ſweare, &amp;c. Therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, they wrote vnto the Lord of Ranconis, declaring vnto him the procéedings of the commander.</p>
                  <p>After this, there were many commandements, &amp; iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, giuen to baniſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore <hi>Valdois,</hi> with the doctrine of the Goſpell: and in the end of October, next following, a rumor went, that an army was leuied to deſtroy them. And there were indéede certaine handes leuied ready to march at an houres warning, and thoſe malefactors which heeretofore were fled, or baniſhed for any offence were now again cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led home, and pardoned: ſo that they would take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their weapons, and goe to deſtroy the Waldois. They in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time, by the councell of their Miniſters, fell to faſting, and prayer, and carried all that they could, of their ſubſtance, vp to the mountaines, prayſing God, and ſinging Pſalmes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
                  <p>The firſt day of Nouember, Angroign (by proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and writings ſet vp in euery place) was expoſed to fire and ſword. The ſecond of Nouember, the armie approched to the borders of the Valley of Luſern, and certaine horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came to a place called S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> a litle beneath Angroign:
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:2659:252"/> then the people returned into the mountaines: certaine of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> perceiuing that the horſemen not onely ſpoyled their goods, but alſo caried their fellowes away priſoners, ſet vpon them: ſo they retired to Bubian, where their campe then was, and not one of them of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> ſlaine or hurt.</p>
                  <p>It happened at the ſame time, that two of the foreſaid horſmen, being ſore amazed, galloped before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt towards the army, being ready to march towards Angroign, crying:<note place="margin">The wicked fly where none perſecuteth.</note> they come, they come: at whoſe cry the whole army was ſo aſtoniſhed, that euery man fled his way: &amp; they were all ſo ſcattered, that the captaines that day were not able to bring them into order againe, and yet no creature followed them.</p>
                  <p>On the ſaturday morning the army muſtered in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow ground néere to Angroign: they of Angroigne had ſent certaine to kéepe the paſſages, and ſtop the army that they ſhould not enter, if it were poſſible: the number was but few, who perceiuing their enemies prepared to fight, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt of all to God to aſſiſt them. When they perceyued their enemies comming toward them, the combat began and endured a long time in the paſſages of Angroigne. At length the Waldois perceyuing themſelues oppreſſed with the multitude of their enemies, retyred to the toppe of the mountaines, where they defended themſelues till night. When they had found a place where they might withſtand their enemies, ſtill purſuing them, they turned themſelues and ſlue diuerſe of them, and hurt many.</p>
                  <p>When the euening came, the enemies reſted, &amp; went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to enca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, there to reſt al night. Which things when the Angroignia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s perceiued, they fell to praier, but the enemies flouted them: then the people deuiſed a policie, to ſend a drum into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valleis hard by: &amp; as they were making their praier vnto God, &amp; the drum ſounded in the valley, the Lord of Trinitie cauſed his ſouldiers, which were about to enca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe themſelues, to remoue thence: which was a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing to the poore people. Many of the enemies that day
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:2659:253"/> were ſlaine, &amp; many hurt, of the which very few eſcaped: of the Angroignians that day were but thrée ſlaine, &amp; one hurt, who was after healed well againe. The L. of Trinitie, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ward, placed gariſons there, &amp; much moleſted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angroig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: &amp; after they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to god by praier, they ſent vnto them of Perouſe, &amp; of S. Martin, and of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gella for aid, ſent them all the helpe that they were able.</p>
                  <p>The next day after, there came letters to Angroigne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the L. of Trinitie, in which he excuſed the outrage that was doone: and required them to ſhew themſelues obedient to the Duke. They againe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaining of their wrongs, offered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all obedience to be reformed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, where they had erred, beſéeching him, and all the Lords of Piedmont, to be their interceſſors to the duke in this behalf.</p>
                  <p>Vpon Munday being 4. of Nouember, the L. of Trinitie ſent his army to Villers, &amp; Tailleret: the leſſer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended toward Villers: the people ſéeing their enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, after they had with praier co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to God, ſtrongly withſtood them, &amp; ſlue many: many alſo were hurt, &amp; ſome fled. The other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany aſcended toward Tailleret, &amp; although they of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place were but few in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, &amp; that part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> army greater, yet making their praiers, &amp; commending their cauſe to God, they likewiſe defended the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In the meane ſeaſon, they of Villers emboldned by their late victory, came to aſſiſt their neighbors, &amp; being aſſembled together, couragiouſly purſued their enemies, &amp; put them to flight. In this purſuit, it chaunced that this poore people by an ambuſh of their enimies, which came another way, were ſuddenly encloſed, and like to be deſtroied: but yet by Gods helpe they all eſcaped, and onely thrée hurt, which were ſoone cured again: on the enemies ſide there were ſo many ſlaine, that they lay together by cartlodes. The ſame day alſo 17. of Roccapiata put to flight a great number of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Sanſon, néere to Roccapiata, that went thether, and ſpoiled a rich man there, of all that he had.</p>

                  <p>After that the L of Trinity had receiued the requeſt, and letters of the Angroignians, he ſent his ſecretary <hi>Gaſtant,</hi> to moue the people, to proſecute a ſupplication to the Duke, promiſing that he would returne with his armie. In which, while they of Angroign perceiued, that a part of the armie, aſcended the hil of Tailleret, and the other part had already gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the way, which led to the medow of Tower (by which meanes, they of Angroign might eaſily be encloſed) they ſent certain to kéep the way: who encountering with their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies, obtained the victorie, not one of them being ſo much as hurt that day. This trechery, the Lord of Trinity excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, putting the fault in them of Tailleret, who had ſlain cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his men in the high way.</p>
                  <p>The 9. of Nouember he vſed the like communication, as before, touching an agréement: ſending for certaine of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groign, to that intent, as he pretended: whom he perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in token of obedience, to laye downe their armour, &amp;c. Which when they had done, he falſified his promiſe, his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the meane time ſpoiling their armour.</p>
                  <p>A few daies after, he ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his ſecretary <hi>Gaſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> to Angroign, to make a ful reſolution of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> agréement, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the people of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groign ſhold ſue for grace to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had taken vp armour for their defence, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould humbly beſéech him to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liberty to continue in their religion they profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp;c. Whervnto they of <hi>S. Ioh,</hi> of <hi>Roccapiata,</hi> of <hi>S. Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew</hi> of Perouſe, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other of the valley of Perouſe, agréed. Now while they were treating of this agréement, the L. of Trinity vexed cruelly them of Tailleret, pretending the cauſe, for that they came not to this agréement: for which cauſe, his ſouldiers ſpoyled and ſacked moſt lamentably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers daies together. Al which being done, the L. of Trinity cauſed the chiefe of the people to aſſemble together, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded 20000. crowns toward the charges of the Dukes maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his army, againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in time paſt. But by the means of his ſecretary <hi>Gaſtant,</hi> who was promiſed an 100
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:2659:254"/> for a bribe, 4000. were cut of: ſo they graunted 16. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, whereof the Duke releaſed the one halfe.</p>
                  <p>The poore people being required to pay the 8000. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, were faine to ſell that they had for a little to make a ſumme: and although the money were paide, yet the army retired not but dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded anew, &amp; forced them to promiſe the payment of 8000. crownes: which the Duke releaſed. This done, he went about to ſlea their miniſters, but chiefly the miniſter of Angroign, whom, when they could not gette, they ſpoiled his houſe and burnt his bookes, and ſpoiled 40. houſes in Angroign, broke their milles, and carried away the corn and meale, which they found there: and, to be ſhort, the practiſes of cruelty ſhewed vpon the poore people conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, was very ſtrange: as for example, they tooke at Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leret, <hi>Odul Gemet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Odull Gemer.</note> a man of ſixtie yéers of age, and put him to a cruel death: for when they had bound him, they tooke a kind of thing, called in French <hi>Eſcarboth,</hi> and put them to his nauell, couering them with a diſhe, which within ſhort ſpace pearced into his bellie, and killed him.</p>
                  <p>The meſſengers which were ſent to the Duke, after they had béene detained there 6. wéeks, and cruelly handled, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the miſeries ſuſtained before, brought a new commaundement, that al muſt go to maſſe: wherevppon, they ſent, and declared their diſtreſſe to them of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in Daulphin: who hearing therof, ioyned themſelues together in league, for maintenance of the trueth: for which cauſe, certaine of the miniſters, and elders of the Church of Daulphin, were ſent to the valley of Luſern: who arriuing there at eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at the village of Boly, word was brought, that ſuch as would not go to maſſe, ſhold be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned to be burnt, or ſent to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gallies, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they heard, they exhorted one another, ſaying: let vs now make ſolemne proteſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wée wil vtterly forſake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falſe religion of the pope, &amp; that we wil liue and die in the conſtant profeſſion of Gods holy worde, and trueth. Let vs go tomorowe to the temple to heare

To this euerie man agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and in the very ſame houre in which they were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to anſwere the commandement, they performed their agréement, both at Bobie, and at Villiers: whether as they went, they encountred a band of ſouldiers, and put them to flight, the 7. of Feb. In the meane time, the L. of Trinitie (after he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted diuers outrages) being ſore beaten of the Angrognians, &amp; diuers of his men ſlain, eſpecially one of great authoritie in the D. court) blewe a retrait, &amp; deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to Angroign, and there (y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people being fled to the medow of Tower) burnt 1000. houſes, &amp; made great ſpoyle. Where, although they oftentimes aſſayed to ſet fire on the two tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the Miniſters houſe, yet could they not fire them.</p>
                  <p>Afterward, the Lord of Trinitie burnt Roſa,<note place="margin">Roſa deſtroied</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed it with fire and ſword. But the Angroignians had afterwards ſuch a hande of the aduerſaries, that they put them to flight, with great ſlaughter. There was one of 18. yeres of age, and but ſmall of ſtature, which alone ſlue the Lord of Monteil, Maſter of the Campe, as it was tolde to the K. Another ſimple man threw downe <hi>Charles Truchet,</hi> with the ſtroke of a ſtone, and a young man leapt vpon him, and ſlue him with his owne ſword, which was four fingers broade, and claue his head in ſunder. This <hi>Truchet</hi> was one of the principall authors of this warre, and their chiefe enemie. The Angroignians purſued them more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mile, and made great ſlaughter.</p>
                  <p>The 18. of Februarie, the L. of Trinitie not ſatiſfied w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> burning, &amp; deſtroying the greateſt part of townes &amp; cities, endeuoured to burne and ſpoyle all the little Villages rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about, pertayning to the ſame: where his, were againe by a fewe, diſcomfited, through the power of God. And when the enemies at any time reſted them, the Angroignians prayed to God, which feared the enemies more, then any thing els.</p>
                  <p>The 18. of March, the L. of Trinitie, with an armie of
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:2659:255"/> ſixe or ſeuen thouſand, aſſayled them again, with the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the countrey: but God gaue them victorie, after they had cried 3. or 4 times, help vs O Lord. The captain of this band was named <hi>Baſtian,</hi> of Vergil, a man very experte in feates of warre. He, at the taking of his iorney threatned to doe great things that day: his hoſtes hearing that, ſaid, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur,</hi> if our religion be better then theirs, we ſhall haue the victorie, els you ſhall not preuaile. Shortly after, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was brought again into his Inne, ſo wounded, and ſo féeble, that he was not like to liue: then ſaid his hoſtes vnto him, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> it is now wel ſéene that their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ours. After that, being aſſayled againe, they man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully defended themſelues, and had almoſt ſtricken the L. of Trinitie with an harquebuſh, for the ſhot brake the wand which he bare in his hand, who ſéeing his Soldiers in ſuch great numbers ſlaine, he wept bitterly. The next day, one of the principal captains of the armie, ſurrendred his charge to the L. of Trinitie, ſaying vnto him, that he woulde neuer fight againſt this people any more, and ſo departed.</p>
                  <p>In that combat there were but 2. of the Waldois ſlayn, and 2. hurt. Through the whole countrey of Piedmount, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man ſayd, God fighteth for them: and the Souldiers themſelues confeſſed,<note place="margin">God fighteth for his people.</note> they were ſo aſtonied, that they could not ſtrike. Moreouer, they ſaid, that this people neuer ſhot, but they killed, or hurt. Some others ſaid, that the miniſters (by their prayers) coniured, or bewitched them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they could not fight. And in trueth, ſuch was the ſucceſſe of this people, that only 14. of them were ſlaine in all theſe conflictes.</p>
                  <p>The 19. of March, there was a hot ſkirmiſh at Angroign: for 3. companies of ſouldiers went thither to burn al that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned: but they were manfully reſiſted, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they, ſéeing the loſſe of their men, retired. After y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, the L. of Trin. endeuored by all falſhood to deſtroy the poor people. It fel out, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the L. of Raconis, ſeming to be ſory for this war, ſent an honeſt man, named <hi>Fran. Gilles,</hi> to the medow of Tower, to take aduiſe
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:2659:255"/> how hee might beſt further the agréement, who hauing conſulted with the miniſters &amp; rulers, and returning home was murthered by two of Angroigne: which greatly gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Waldois, who wrote to the Lord of Raconis, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelues, and declaring how it gréeued them: promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that they would execute vpon them ſuch Iuſtice as was méet in ſuch a caſe. The L of Raconis writ vnto them againe, requiring that the offenders might be deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: whereunto they anſwered: that vpon 3. conditions they ſhould be deliuered. 1. That they ſhould not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to doo any thing againſt their conſciences,<note place="margin">Conditions.</note> &amp; as touching religion nothing ſhould be ſpoken to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God. 2. That ſpedy iuſtice ſhould be done on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; therafter, this ſhold be no preiudice to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liberties &amp; priuiledges of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groign. 3. That the execution ſhould be vpon the borders of Angroign, for example: this was accepted, and the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders deliuered, which did redound greatly to the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Angroignians.</p>
                  <p>After y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the L. of Trinity had greatly vexed them, and yet could not preuaile, the rulers of the Waldois requeſted earneſtly the Lorde of Raconis, to preſent a ſupplication,<note place="margin">Supplication to the Duches of Sauoy.</note> which they had made to the Duches of Sauoy: wherein they declared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> equity of their cauſe, proteſting al due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke, their ſoueraign Lord: &amp; if it might be proued by the word of god, that they had held any error, they would (w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> humble ſubmiſſion) receiue correction, &amp; be reformed: Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly beſéeching her grace, to appeaſe the diſpleaſure that the D. had conceaued againſt them, by the vntrue ſurmiſes of their aduerſaries: and if in any thing they had offended, they craued his moſt gratious pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. About this time, the L. of Trinitie was in danger of death by ſickneſſe. Soon after the ſupplication was deliuered, the duches ſent an anſwere to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Valdois, by the L. of Raconis, of hard conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: as, that they ſhould baniſh their miniſters, receiue the maſſe, &amp; ſuffer no more preaching: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the D. would at his pleaſure make

After which ſupplication view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and read of the Duches,<note place="margin">Libertie gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Waldois.</note> ſhe ſo perſwaded the Duke, that anſwere was made according to their mind, preaching per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with frée libertie, their goods reſtored, and fréedoms, liberties, general and particular reſtored. Yet ſo, that Maſſe ſhould be ſaid in all the pariſhes of theſe Valleis, &amp; no man compelled to come to the ſame: the captiues were alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, that were ſent to the gallies, and reaſonable ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome taken for the priſoners of the Waldois: and ſo, through the meanes of the Ducheſſe, the poore Waldois haue béene quiet vntil this day.</p>

               <p>The king, vntill ſuch time as by conſent of the whole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of parlament, hee might eſtabliſh a more perfect order of religion, purpoſed by the aduiſe of his counſel of his owne authority, ſomewhat to proſecute his godly purpoſe.

During the time that thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were occupied abroad, the king deſiring a farther reformation, appointed a parlament the <hi>4.</hi> of Nouember, in the firſt yéere of his reigne, <hi>Ann. 1547.</hi>

               <p>To al theſe good orders, diuers prieſts, and popiſh Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhewed themſelues vntoward, ſo that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon praier booke was (long after the publiſhing of it) either not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en at all, or els very vnreuerently vſed throughout y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realm: for which, the king with his Counſel prouided redreſſe. <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> yet ſéeming not to diſlike openly of theſe godly procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, yet his minde appeared, by his negligent putting in execution of thoſe Iniunctions, in his owne Dioces.

Whereupon (as hath béene ſayde) he was called before the Counſell, and enioyned to preach, that ſuch as rebell againſt their Prince, reſiſt Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: and to ſet foorth in his Sermon, that the authoritie of the king, was no leſſe in his young age, than was of any of his Predeceſſors, &amp;c. <hi>Boenr,</hi> at his time appointed, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at Paules croſſe:<note place="margin">Muſkleborow field.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the king did immediatly direct foorth his Commiſſion vnder his broad Seale, vnto the Archb. of Canterburie, the B. of Rocheſter, and other Counſellors, geuing them autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to call <hi>Boner</hi> before them, and to deale with him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they ſhould finde cauſe.</p>
               <p>The tenth day of ſeptember, Biſhoppe <hi>Boner</hi> was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to appeare at Lambeth, before the Commiſſioners: before whom he behaued himſelfe moſt vndiſcréetely, and vnreuerently: defacing the authoritie of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, and ſhifting of the poynt hee was accuſed of: and in the ende pulled out a Proteſtation out of his boſome, readie written, and exhibited it vnto the Commiſſioners. Vnder which proteſtation, he requeſted to haue a copie both of the Commiſſion, and accuſation: with time to anſwere theru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to.

And when he had finiſhed reading of his anſweres: <hi>Latimer</hi> deliuered vp a writing vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, containing Articles agaynſt him: whereof cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine were touching his owne fact: as whether he wrote his ſermon or not, to which he anſwered: that onely he penned certaine notes: then, what aduiſe and whoſe he had: to which he anſwered his owne onely with helpe of his bookes. And this he anſwered, an oth being miniſtred vnto him <hi>Ex offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio mero.</hi> Theſe wordes ended, the Commiſſioners aſſigned him Munday the xvj. of September then next, to appeare before them, and to make his full anſweres to all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles miniſtred vnto him by them that day.</p>
               <p>On Mundaie the ſixtenth of September hée appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth againe before the Commiſſioners, and exhibiteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them anſweres vnto the laſte Articles: but before the ſame were read, the Archbiſhop declared vnto him that his anſwere made againſt his accuſers denunciation contained matter of ſlander againſt them: and ſo ſignified that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired there to purge themſelues; which they both did, firſt <hi>Latimer</hi> and next <hi>Hooper.</hi> And after much vnſéemely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of <hi>Boner,</hi> the Commiſſioners willed him to make aunſwere to the articles obiected the laſt day againſt him:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2659:299"/> which he did, reading it and anſwering to euery poynt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſlenderly: as to the point of the kings authoritie, that he had gathered a note out of Hiſtories and Scriptures of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe yoong Kinges, who notwithſtanding their minoritie were faithfully obeied, and reputed for very lawfull kings, all which with many other, hée had purpoſed to declare, if they had come vnto his memorie, which they did not: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for lacke of vſe of preachyng, and partly by reaſon of a bill which was deliuered him from the Kinges counſell, to declare the victorie hée had agaynſt the rebels, which confounded his memorie: and partely for that his booke fell (in his Sermon time) from him, wherein were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe of his notes which hée had collected for that purpoſe. Which anſwere pleaſed not the Commiſſioners, who requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to make it more direct, whether he had doone as hée was enioyned or not: whereto when he would no otherwiſe anſwere, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners did admit preſently for witneſſes vpon articles againſt him: M. <hi>Iohn Cheeke, Henry Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iohn Ioſeph, Iohn Douglas,</hi> and <hi>Richard Chambers:</hi> vpon whom they laid a corporall oth, truely to anſwere. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> againſt this, vnder his former proteſtation, proteſted of the nullitie of the receiuing and admitting, and ſwearing of thoſe witneſſes, with proteſtation alſo to obiect againſt the perſons and ſayings of theſe witneſſes: demaunding a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and competent time to miniſter interrogatories againſt them. Wherewith the Commiſſioners were contented: ſo that day he obiected againſt M. <hi>Cheeke,</hi> and the next day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noone he obiected againſt the reſt.</p>
               <p>After this the Commiſſioners aſſigned to the Biſhop to appeare againe before them vpon Wedneſday the next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuyng, betwéene the houres of ſeuen and eight before noone, at Lambeth: there to ſhewe the cauſe why hee ſhould not be declared <hi>Pro confeſſo</hi> vpon all the Articles: wherevnto hée had not then fully aunſwered: but <hi>Boner</hi> ſtill prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the nullitie and inualiditie of al their procéedings, they

               <p>In the meane while, the Commiſſioners certified the K. and his counſel of the B. behauiour, and cauillations. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the king the <hi>17.</hi> of September did ſend vnto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, a full declaration of his owne will, giuing them full authoritie to procéede at their owne diſcretions.

In the end they mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred vnto him new articles, and receiued witneſſes againſt him: but <hi>Boner</hi> ſtill ſtoode vpon the nullitie of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and the whole proceſſe, deſiring a copie of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: which was graunted, and time, til the next day at viij. of the clocke.

                  </note> So the Commiſſioners appointed him a new time to appeare on munday next, betwéene <hi>6.</hi> &amp; <hi>9.</hi> in the morning: then to ſhew a finall cauſe why he ſhoulde not be iudged <hi>pro confeſſo.</hi> And they deliuered him a copy of the Articles.</p>

The twentieth of September hée appeared nowe the fift time: and hauing made a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and doubtfull anſwere, refuſed Syr <hi>Thomas Smithes</hi> iudgement, becauſe hée ſawe him ſharper bent agaynſt him then the reſt: and made alſo his appeale to the King: and withall verye vnreuerently behaued himſelfe tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes the Commiſſioners. For which cauſe Maiſter Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie <hi>Smith</hi> commaunded the Marſhalles deputie, to take <hi>Boner</hi> Priſoner, and to keepe him that no man might come vnto him, and aſſigned him to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them againe on Mundaye nexte before noone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene ſeuen and nine of the clocke.

The firſt day D. <hi>Weſton</hi> inueyeth againſt the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme, and booke of Common prayer of king <hi>Edward:</hi> and ſignified, that on Friday next, the xx. of October, it ſhould be lawful for all men fréely to ſpeake their conſciences in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion.</p>
               <p>The Friday being come, in ſteade of diſputation, the Prolocutor exhibited two ſeuerall Billes vnto the Houſe:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2659:306"/> the one, of the naturall preſence of Chriſt in the ſacrament, and the other, that the Catechiſme was not ſet out by the houſes conſent: requiring all to ſubſcribe to theſe Billes, as he himſelfe had done. To which motion all did aſſent, ſauing the Deane of Rocheſter, the Dean of Exceter, the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con of Wincheſter, the Archdeacon of Hertforde, and the Archdeacon of Stow, and one other. And while the reſt were ſubſcribing, <hi>Iohn Philpot</hi> ſtoode vp, and declared that the Catechiſme was ſet out by the aſſent of the houſe: and as touching the poynt of naturall preſence, that it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon, that men ſhould ſubſcribe before the matter were diſcuſſed: and withall, deſired the Prolocutor, that he would be a meane to the Counſell, that ſome of thoſe that were the ſetters out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame catechiſme, might be brought into the houſe, to ſhew their learning that moued them to ſet forth the ſame: and that D. <hi>Ridley,</hi> &amp; M. <hi>Rogers,</hi> with two or thrée more, might be licenſed to be preſent at this diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to be aſſociated with them. The biſhops made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, it was not for them to cal ſuch perſons vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe, ſince ſome of them were priſoners: but they would be Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners in this behalfe to the Counſell: and in caſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were abſent, that ought to be of the houſe, they willed them to be taken in vnto them if they liſted.</p>
               <p>After this, they minding to haue entered into diſputation, worde was geuen, that the Lorde great Maſter, and the Earle of Deuonſhire woulde be preſent at the Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and therefore the Prolocutor deferred the ſame till the next Mundaye at one of the Clocke at after Noone. At which time, (many Nobles being aſſembled to heare the Diſputation,) the Prolocutor ſayde: that they of the houſe had appointed this Diſputation, not to call the trueth in doubt, the which they had all ſubſcribed, ſauing fiue or ſixe: but that thoſe gaineſayers might be reſolued.</p>
               <p>Then hée demaunded of Maſter <hi>Haddon,</hi> whether hée woulde reaſon againſt the queſtions propoſed. To whome
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2659:306"/> he anſwered, hée would; ſeing the requeſt for thoſe learned men to aſſiſt would not bée graunted: and ſo aunſwered M. <hi>Elmer,</hi> and ſaid, that little or nothing it might auaile for the trueth, ſince now all they were determined to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. After this he demaunded of Maiſter <hi>Cheney,</hi> who allowed of the preſence, but denied the tranſubſtantiation. Maſter <hi>Cheney</hi> anſwered, he would gladly haue his doubts reſolued on that point: and ſo propounding his doubts, the Prolocutor aſſigned M. <hi>Mooreman</hi> to aunſwere. By this meanes Maiſter <hi>Elmer</hi> was driuen to ſtand vp, and ſo M. <hi>Philpot,</hi> who reaſoned againſt M. <hi>Mooreman</hi> and grauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him. Then ſtood vp the deane of Rocheſter, M. <hi>Philpot,</hi> who diſputed of the real preſence: whom <hi>Weſton</hi> anſwered, and <hi>Watſon</hi> tooke his parte. Vpon whome <hi>Philpot</hi> replieth againe, and in the end the diſputation grew to be confuſed,<note place="margin">The diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on confuſed.</note> by reaſon many would take vpon them to anſwere.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday the xxv. of October, <hi>Iohn Philpot,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the appointment, was ready to diſpute about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all preſence, and was ready to enter into a Latine oration, made to interpret the queſtion: this y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prolocutor would not ſuffer: and beſides, contrary to their order, compelled him to make his arguments in Engliſh, which he did, &amp; was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the Prolocutor, that he fell downe on his knées before the Earles and Lords, deſiring them that he might haue libertie to proſecute his argument: but the Prolocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſtill interrupted.<note place="margin">The Prolocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupteth <hi>Philpot.</hi>
                  </note> Doctor <hi>Chadſey</hi> being the reſpondent in the end, hée hauing ſcarſe ſpent one argument of a doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, in the matter of the preſence in the Sacrament, was threatned of the Prolocutor to bée ſent to pryſon, except hée gaue ouer. So <hi>Philpot</hi> ſéeing himſelfe and the good cauſe ſo oppreſſed, ended, ſaying thus: A ſort of you here, which hitherto haue lurked in corners, and diſſembled with God and the worlde, are nowe gathered together to ſuppreſſe the ſincere trueth of Gods woorde, and to ſette foorth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie falſe deuiſe, whiche by the Catholicke doctrine of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2659:307"/> Scripture you are not able to maintaine.</p>
               <p>Then ſtepped foorth M. <hi>Elmer</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Elmer.</note> Chaplaine to the duke of Suffolke, whom M. <hi>Mooreman</hi> tooke vpon him to anſwer, and after him the prolocutor called M. <hi>Haddon</hi> Deane of Exceter, to confirme M. <hi>Elmers</hi> argument, to whome Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Watſon</hi> tooke vpon him to anſwere. Then ſtept foorth M. <hi>Perne,</hi> and in argument made declaration of his minde againſt Tranſubſtantiation, and confirmed the ſayinges of of M. <hi>Elmer</hi> and M. <hi>Haddon:</hi> whome the prolocutor bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, becauſe the Friday before, he had ſubſcribed to the contrary: and ſo for that the night did approch, and the time was ſpent, the Prolocutor giuing them praiſes for their learning,<note place="margin">The Romiſh church againſt reaſon or ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture,</note> did yet notwithſtanding conclude, that all reaſon ſet apart, the order of the holy church muſt be receiued, and all things muſt be ordered thereby.</p>
               <p>On Friday the xxvij. of October M. <hi>Haddon</hi> Deane of Exceter did enter diſpute againſt <hi>Watſon, Morgan,</hi> and <hi>Harpſfield:</hi> and when <hi>Watſon</hi> was driuen to a pinch, and to denie <hi>Theodoret,</hi> for that he ſaid, hée was a <hi>Neſtorian,</hi> hée deſired he might aunſwere maiſter <hi>Chenie:</hi> and after much diſpute with <hi>Watſon</hi> and his fellowes, then aſked the Prolocutor of maiſter <hi>Haddon</hi> and his fellowes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would anſwere them other thrée daies, <hi>Haddon, Chenie,</hi> and <hi>Elmer</hi> ſaid no: but the Archdeacon of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Philpot</hi> a hartie man.</note> maiſter <hi>Philpot</hi> ſtood vp, and ſaid: that although all other did refuſe to anſwere, yet he would not, but offered to anſwere them all one after another. With whoſe proffer the Prolocutor beyng not contented, railed on him, and ſaid hée ſhould go to Bedlem. To whome the Archdeacon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that hée was more worthie to be ſent thither. Who vſed himſelfe ſo ragingly in that diſputation, without any indifferent equalitie. Then roſe Doctor <hi>Weſton</hi> vp &amp; ſaid: all the company hath ſubſcribed to our Articles, ſauing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe menne which you ſée: wée haue aunſwered them thrée daies, vppon promiſſe that they ſhoulde aunſwere vs
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2659:307"/> againe as long: and if they be able to defend their doctrine, let them ſo doe. Then <hi>Elmer</hi> affirmed, that they neuer promiſed to diſpute: but only to teſtifie their conſciences, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now (ſaid he) doe we meane to anſwere, til our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which we haue propounded, be ſoluted according as it was appointed: for we ſhould profit nothing, ſeing the matter is already decréed vpon.</p>
               <p>On munday following béeing the thirtie of October, the Prolocutor demanded of maiſter <hi>Philpot,</hi> whether he would anſwere: who ſaid he would ſo doe, if they would according to their former determination, firſt anſwere ſufficiently ſome of his argumentes, yea euen but one, although hée had a dozen. So he was permitted to propound. His arguments was, Chriſt is aſcended into heauen, therefore he is not preſent on the earth corporally. This argument <hi>Morgan,</hi>

                  <hi>Weſton, Harpesfield</hi> were grauelled with. And when <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot</hi> denied that the Church was before the Scripture, and denied a friuolous reaſon which he brought to prooue the ſame: <hi>Morgan</hi> ſaide fye fye, hée hath no learning. With whome when <hi>Philpot</hi> compared himſelfe, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutor commaunded him that hée ſhoulde come no more into the houſe. To whom <hi>Philpot</hi> ſayde, hée might thinke himſelfe happie to bée out of their companie. Then after <hi>Morgan</hi> had rounded the Prolocutor in the eare, hée ſayde vnto him: wée are content, you ſhould come into the houſe, ſo yée bée apparrelled in a long gowne and a tippet as we be, and that you ſhall not ſpeake but when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you.

At which wordes diuers of the learned men laughed.

And in the ende they ſo preuayled, that he agréed ſometimes to ſhew himſelfe apparrelled as the other biſhops were. Afterwards (king <hi>Edward</hi> being dead, and <hi>Marie</hi> being crowned Quéene) this good Biſhop was one of the firſt that was ſent for by a Purſiuant, to be at London.

                  <hi>Anno 1555.</hi> The ix. of February Doctor <hi>Taylor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> martyr.</note> doctor of both the lawes, was burned at Hadley the towne where he was Paſtor. The cauſe of his trouble was one <hi>Foſter</hi> a petigentleman, after the ſort of a Lawier, a kéeper of courts, and one <hi>Iohn Clerke</hi> of Hadley, becauſe he reſiſted <hi>Iohn A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer</hi> parſon of Aldam, who would haue ſaid Maſſe in Hadley church.

After that D. <hi>Taylor</hi> had lyen in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a while, he was cited to appeare in the arches at Bow-church, there to anſwere &amp;c. &amp; ſo to be depriued: who ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the matter of his mariage by ſcriptures, doctors, lawes, ciuill &amp; canon, that the iudge could giue no ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to diuorſe him: but gaue ſentence of depriuation becauſe he was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.

After ſentence of condemnation of them all, the Biſhop called for <hi>William Hunter,</hi> and perſwaded with him, ſaying: if thou wilt yet recant, I will make thée a frée man in the Citie, and giue thée fortie pounds in good mony to ſet vp thine occupation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: or I will make thée Stewarde of my houſe, and I will preferre thée &amp;c.

               <p>Now when <hi>William</hi> was come downe into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to Burntwood, whiche was the Saturday before the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary that followed on the Munday after, <hi>William</hi> remained till the Tueſday, becauſe they would not put him to death then, for the holynes of the day.

Then <hi>William</hi> aunſwered: for my little payne whiche I ſhall ſuffer, whiche is but ſhort,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2659:323"/> Chriſt hath promiſed me (ſaid he) a crowne of ioy: may you not be glad of that mother? with other ſuch words of ioy and comfort on both partes. Thus paſſing away ſaterday, Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and munday: on Tueſday morning, when it was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Sheriffe maiſter <hi>Brocket</hi> called on to ſet forward to the burning of <hi>William Hunter.</hi> Whoſe ſonne yet did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and comfort <hi>William.</hi> At the place of his martyrdom, there was a Popiſh prieſt that endeuoured to peruert him at the ſtake, and ſaide vnto him: as thou burneſt here, ſo ſhalt thou burne in hell. To whom <hi>William</hi> anſwered: thou lyeſt falſe prophet, away thou falſe prophet, away. His brother béeyng by, ſaide vnto him: <hi>William,</hi>

And caſting downe his head againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſmothering ſmoke, hée yéelded vp his life for the trueth.</p>

               <p>About the ſame moneth of March, one <hi>Rawlins White</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rawlins Whit</note> a Fiſherman, was burned at Cardiffe, for the teſtimonie of Ieſus. He being deſirous of knowledge, (him ſelfe not able to reade) ſet his ſonne to ſchoole, to learne to reade: and vſed to haue him reade vnto him the Scriptures, and other good bookes. Whereby he greatly profited in knowledge, and did inſtruct, and conuert diuers. In which good courſe Father <hi>Rawlins</hi> continued, til at laſt he was taken by the officers of the Towne, as a man ſuſpected of hereſie. Vpon which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, he was conuented before the Biſhoppe of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daffe: by whom (after diuers combats) he was committed to priſon in Chepſtowe, with ſuch libertie, as <hi>Rawlins</hi> might, (if he would) haue eſcaped: but that notwithſtanding, hee continued ſtill, and at the laſt was remoued to the Caſtle of Cardiff, where he remained a yere, paſſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time in praier, and exhortation to his frends, &amp; thoſe that came to viſit him.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2659:326"/> After a yere, the Biſhop cauſed him to be brought vnto his owne houſe by Chepſtowe: where (after many aſſayes) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing he could not preuaile, gaue him a day of determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which being expired, the Biſhoppe calleth for him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; and after exhortation to recant, he procéedeth to the ſentence of condemnation: ſauing before he ſaid, he woulde pray for <hi>Rawlins,</hi> that God would ſende ſome ſparke of grace vpon him. I thanke you hartely for your gentleneſſe (ſayth <hi>Rawlins</hi>) and if ſo be that your requeſt he godly, and lawfull, and that you pray as you ſhould pray, without all doubt God will heare you. And therefore my Lord, go to: do you pray to your God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rawlins</hi> God &amp; the biſhops God.</note> and I will pray to my God. I know that my God wil both heare my prayer, and perfourme my deſire.</p>
               <p>After prayer the Biſhop ſaide, Now <hi>Rawlins,</hi> how is it with thée? &amp;c. Surely (ſaid he) my Lord, <hi>Rawlins</hi> you lefte me, and <hi>Rawlins</hi> you finde me, and by Gods grace <hi>Rawlins</hi> I will continue. Certainly if your petitions had béene good, and lawfull, God would haue heard them: but you honour a falſe God, and pray not as you ſhould pray, and therefore hath not God graunted your deſire. But I am a poore ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple man, as you ſée, and God hath heard my complaint: and I truſt he will ſtrengthen me in his owne cauſe. When their prayer would not preuaile, they aduiſed to ſay a maſſe, to ſée what that would worke. In the meane time <hi>Rawlins</hi> be tooke him to prayer in a ſecrete place, till ſuch time as the Prieſt came to the ſacring. When <hi>Rawlins</hi> heard the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring bell ring, he roſe out of his place, and came to the quire dore, and ſtanding a while, turned himſelfe to the people, ſpeaking theſe wordes: Good people, if there be at the leaſt but one brother among you, the ſame one ſhall beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at the day of iudgement, that I howe not to this Idoll, meaning the hoſt that the Prieſt helde ouer his head. Maſſe being ended, and <hi>Rawlins</hi> perſiſting conſtant, the Biſhoppe procéedeth to ſentence, and hauing condemned him, diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2659:326"/> him to be carried againe to Cardiffe, there to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the priſon of the towne, called <hi>Clockemacell,</hi> a very dark lothſome, and moſt vile priſon: where <hi>Rawlins</hi> paſſed the time in ſinging of Pſalmes.</p>
               <p>About thrée or foure wéekes after, he hauing intelligence that his tyme of death drewe néere, ſendeth foorthwith to his wife, and willeth her by the meſſenger, that in any wiſe ſhe ſhould make readie,<note place="margin">

               <p>Now apparelled in his wedding garments, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houre was come, and he paſſed to his death, in the way his poore wife and children ſtood wéeping, and making lamentation: which ſo pearced his heart, that hee let fall teares from his eyes: but ſoone after, as though he had miſliked his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, beganne to be angry with himſelfe: inſomuch that ſtriking his breſt with his hande, hée vſed theſe wordes: Ah fleſh, ſtayeſt thou me ſo? wouldeſt thou faine preuaile?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rawlins</hi> a worthy martyr.</note> Well, I tell thée, do what thou canſt, thou ſhalt not by Gods grace haue the victorie. By this time hée came to the ſtake, and going towards it, he fell down vpon his knées and kiſſed the ground: and in riſing againe, the earth a little ſticking on his face, he ſaide theſe words: Earth vnto earth and duſt vnto duſt: thou art my mother, and to thée ſhall I returne. Then went he cherefully, and very ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the ſtake, and ſet his backe cloſe thereunto: and when hée had ſtoode there a while, he caſt his eye vpon the Reporter of this Hiſtory, calling him vnto him, and ſayde, I féele a great fighting betwixt the Fleſhe and the Spirit: and the Fleſhe woulde very fayne haue his ſwinge, and therefore I pray you when you ſéeme any thing tempted, holde your finger vp to me, and I truſt I ſhall remember my ſelfe. After the Smith had made him faſt to the Stake, according as hée had required him, being afrayde of his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2659:327"/> infirmitie, and the Officers began to laie wood to him with ſtrawe and réede,) hée himſelfe as farre as hée could reach, would catcht the ſame, and very chéerefully diſpoſed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his bodie. When all thinges were readie, then ſtept vp a Prieſt, addreſſing himſelfe to ſpeake, and to peruert the people. Which when <hi>Rawlins</hi>

And then ſaid vnto the preacher: oh thou naughtie hypocrite, dooſt thou preſume to prooue thy falſe doctrine by Scripture? Looke in the text what followeth: did not Chriſt ſay, doo this in remembrance of mée: after which wordes the Prieſt beyng amazed, held his peace. Then ſome that ſtood by, cried: put too fire, put to fire: which being put to, he bathed his handes ſo long in the flame, till the ſinewes ſhrunke, and the fatte dropped away: and once he did as it were wipe his face with one of them. All this while (which was ſomewhat long) he cried with a loud voice: O Lord receiue my ſoule, vntill he could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his mouth. He was at the ſame time of his death, about <hi>60.</hi> yéeres of age.</p>
               <p>About this time, <hi>Anno 1555.</hi> the <hi>28.</hi> of March, Quéene <hi>Marie</hi> was fully reſolued, and declared ſo much to foure of her Counſell, to reſtore the Abbey landes againe to the Church.

                  <hi>Anno 1555.</hi> the xxiiij. of Aprill <hi>George Marſh</hi>
                  <note place="margin">George Marſh</note> ſuffered moſt conſtantly at Wincheſter for the teſtimonie of the truth. For a while he was Curate to <hi>Laurence Saunders:</hi> in which condition he continued for a ſpace. But at length by detection of certaine aduerſaries, hée was apprehended and kept in cloſe pryſon by <hi>George Cotes</hi> then Biſhop of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, in ſtraight priſon in Cheſter in the biſhops houſe about the ſpace of foure moneths, beyng not permitted to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léefe and comfort of his fréends.</p>
               <p>The Wedneſday before Palmeſunday, he voluntarily preſented himſelfe (being ſought for) before Maſter <hi>Barton,</hi> who ſent him the next day before the Earle of Darbie and his Counſell at Latha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Where appearing before them, and not anſwering to their contentment touching the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Altar, he was committed to ward in a cold wide ſtone houſe: where he lay two nights without any bed, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a few canuaſſe tentclothes, and a paire of ſhéets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out woollen clothes: and ſo continued he till Palmeſunday, beyng occupied in prayer and godly meditation.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:2659:328"/>
               <p>On Palmſunday at after dinner, he appeared again: and comming with the Vicar of Preſcot, the Vicar made report to the Earle, that the anſwer which he made, was ſufficient for a beginner, vnto ſuch time as he ſhould learne farther. Wherewith the Earle was very well pleaſed: and ſo after few words, commanded he ſhould haue a bed, with fire, and liberty to go among his ſeruants, ſo he would not hurt them with his communication.</p>
               <p>Thus he departed more troubled then before, becauſe he had not with more boldnes confeſſed Chriſt: but in ſuch ſort as the aduerſaries thought they might preuaile againſt him. So he praied to God for more ſtrength. And after a day or two, confeſſed more plainly, and more boldly in ſuch ſort, as the Vicar was not well pleaſed.</p>
               <p>After which, within a day or two came to him againe M. <hi>Moore,</hi> bringing with him certaine articles, whervnto Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Crome</hi> had ſubſcribed in the daies of king <hi>Henrie</hi> the viij. requiring him alſo to ſubſcribe: whereto he would in no ſort agrée, and ſo he departed. Within a ſhort ſpace after, on ſhrouethurſeday, the Vicar ſent for him againe, ſaying: my Lord would be at a ſhort point with him, if he woulde not ſubſcribe to <hi>4.</hi> articles: wherof thrée tended to the maſſe, and the fourth touching confeſſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe articles he denied to ſubſcribe vnto, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Porters ward: where he continued till Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunday. On which day after dinner, his kéeper <hi>Richard Scot</hi> ſignified vnto him, that <hi>2.</hi> young men came to carrie him to Lancaſter. And ſo was he carried thither by them: and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the ſeſſions among malefactors, and was thriſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned among théeues, with yrons on his féete: and with boldnes confeſſed Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Within few daies after, <hi>Marſh</hi> was remoued from La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter, and comming to Cheſter, was ſent for of D. <hi>Cotes,</hi> the B. to appeare before him in his hall, no body being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but they twaine. Where the B. communed with him,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2659:329"/> and laboured to peruert him: but all in vaine. And after he had taken his pleaſure in puniſhing him, and reuiling him, he cauſed him to be brought forth into a chappel in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall church in Cheſter, called our Ladies Chappel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, at two of the clocke in the after noone: who was there placed in a chaire for that purpoſe, and <hi>Fulke Dutton</hi> maior of that citie D. <hi>Wall,</hi> and other prieſts aſſiſting him. And after they had cauſed him to take an othe, they mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred articles vnto him. To which he anſwered according to the doctrine taught in king <hi>Edwards</hi> daies: which being regiſtred, he was returned againe to his priſon. Within thrée wéekes after he appeared againe: and after many vain perſwaſions to recant, he receiued ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was carried away, and put into a darke priſon, where he had ſmal comfort of any creature til his death. Yet ſome of the citizens that feared God, would comfort him at a hole in a wall of the citie, and giue him money.</p>
               <p>When the day appointed came that he ſhould ſuffer: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes of the city, <hi>Amry</hi> &amp; <hi>Cooper,</hi> with their officers tooke him out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Northgate where he was priſoner, who came with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt méekly with a locke on his foot, &amp; being at the place of his death, he refuſed the pardon of the Quéen, which was offred him if he would recant. Which he ſaid he would gladly accept: but foraſmuch as it tended to plucke him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, he would not receiue it vpon ſuch condition. So after he had praied, he put off his clothes to his ſhirt, &amp; being faſtned to the poſt, by reaſon the fire was vnſkilfully made, he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with great patience grieuous torment. So that when he had a long time bin tormented in the fire without mouing, hauing his fleſh ſo broyled and puft vp, that it couered the chaine wherwith he was faſtned: hee therefore was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be dead.

                     <hi>George Marſh</hi> of great pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> ſaying: Father of heauen haue mercy on me: &amp; ſo yelded. Vpon this y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people ſaid, he was a martyr. And the Biſh. to quiet them, ſhortly after made a ſermon, affirming
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2659:329"/> that he was an Heretike, &amp;c. and a firebrand in hell. Whom in recompence not long after, the hand of God did ſo ſtrike, that hee dyed (as it was thought) burned of an Harlotte. This Martir did write diuers and ſundrie bookes out of priſon.</p>
               <p>The xxiiij. of Aprill, <hi>William Flower,</hi> ſometime a Monke of Ely, and a Prieſt, but afterward being married, liued by teaching of children, was put to death for the teſtimony of the trueth, and had his hand firſt ſtricken of, for ſtriking a Prieſt ſaying maſſe. Comming from Lambeth (where he dwelt) about tenne or eleuen of the clocke in the forenoone, into Saint Margarets Church at Weſtminſter: where he finding and ſéeing a prieſt, called <hi>Iohn Cheltam,</hi> miniſtring the Sacrament of the Altar to the people, therewith being offended in his conſcience, did ſtrike and wounde him vpon the head, and alſo vpon the arme and hande with his wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife:<note place="margin">

               <p>Vpon this acte <hi>William Flower</hi> being firſt apprehended, was laid in the Gatehouſe at Weſtminſter, where he had giuen two groates before, the ſame day to one: ſaying, hée would ſhortly come to him with as many Irons as he could beare.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2659:330"/> called for depoſitions of certaine witneſſes, and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſentence againſt him.</p>
               <p>Vpon the xxiiij. day of April he was brought to the place of Martirdome, which was in Saint Margarets Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde at Weſtminſter, where the fact was committed. And there comming to the ſtake whereat he ſhoulde bee burned; firſt he maketh his praier vnto God, with a confeſſion of the Chriſtian faith. At the ſtriking off of his hand he did not once ſhrinke, but once he ſtirred a little his ſhoulders. And thus fire was ſet vnto him, who burning there, cried with a loud voice thrée times: <hi>Oh Sonne of God, haue mercy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me.</hi> And when his voice fayled, he held vp his armes, till he died, being ſtricken downe for wante of fire ſufficient, (where his nether partes were burned) yet he being in the fire, his tongue moued in his head.</p>
               <p>The iij. of May, a letter was ſent to <hi>George Colt,</hi> and <hi>T. Daniel,</hi> to make ſearch for, and to apprehend <hi>I. Bernard</hi> and <hi>I.

Where the Papiſtes were ſo much gréeued at him for his doctrine, that in his reading they cut &amp; mangled his gowne with their kniues. He beyng apprehended in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, with Maiſter <hi>Barlow</hi> biſhop of Bath was brought to London and layed in the Fléeter King <hi>Edwards</hi> lawes yet beyng in force till the Parlement ended, which deliuered the Biſhops authoritie, and power ouer the profeſſors of the Goſpell. At which time theſe two were both brought before Wincheſter &amp; other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners, who anſwered in ſuch ſort vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that Wincheſter with his fellow commiſſioners allowed them for catholicke, glad to haue a forged example of a ſhrinking brother: which alſo they obiected againſt others, commending the ſoberneſſe of them twaine. This notwithſtanding, <hi>Barnard</hi> was led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the Fléete. From whence he afterward beyng de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, did by exile conſtantly beare witneſſe to the truth.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2659:331"/> 
                  <hi>Cardmaker</hi> was conueyed to the Counter in Bredſtréete, the Biſhop of London procuring it to be publiſhed, that hée ſhould ſhortly be deliuered, after that hée had ſubſcribed to Tranſubſtantiation, and certaine other Articles.</p>
               <p>To the ſame priſon where <hi>Cardmaker</hi> was, <hi>Laurence Saunders</hi> was brought, after ſentence of death was giuen againſt him, &amp; they had great comfort one of another. After whoſe departure <hi>Cardmaker</hi> remained alone, bayted of the Papiſtes. Againſt whom Doctor <hi>Martine</hi> tooke vpon him to be a chéefe dooer by writing, whome <hi>Cardmaker</hi> did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially confute. When the Biſhop perceiued no hope to peruert theſe conſtant ſeruants of God, hée pronounced ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt them. And vpon the xxx. day of Maie, <hi>Iohn Cardmaker</hi> with <hi>Iohn Warne</hi> were brought by the Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where they ſhould ſuffer.

The people which before had heard that <hi>Cardmaker</hi> would recant, and beholding this manner of dooing, were in a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous dumpe and ſadnes, thinking in déede that <hi>Cardma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> would now recant at the burning of <hi>Warne.</hi> At length <hi>Cardmaker</hi> departed from the Shiriffes &amp; came towards the ſtake, and in his garments, as hée was knéeling downe made a long prayer in ſilence to himſelfe, yet the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed themſelues in their fantaſie of his recanting, ſéeing him in his garmentes praying ſecréetly and no reſemblance of any burning.</p>
               <p>His prayers being ended, hée roſe vp, put of his clothes vnto his ſhirte, went with bolde courage to the ſtake and kiſſed it ſwéetely, hée tooke <hi>Warne</hi> by the hand, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him hartely,<note place="margin">

They were both huſbandmen in the pariſh of Wigborow in Eſſex, and almoſt both of one age, ſaue that <hi>Simſon</hi> was of the age of <hi>34.</hi> and the other of <hi>30.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Hawks</hi> was one of the <hi>6.</hi> men condemned in one day of <hi>Boner,</hi> the <hi>9</hi> of February: and put to death the tenth of Iune. Hee was borne in Eſſex, and by profeſſion a Courtier, and ſeruant to the Earle of Oxforde, till God tooke King <hi>Edward</hi> out of this world. He had borne to him a ſonne, whoſe baptiſme he deferred to the thirde wéeke, for that hée would not haue him baptiſed after the Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall manner. For which cauſe, the aduerſaries laid hands on him, and brought him to the Earle of Oxford. The Earle ſendeth him vp to London, with letters to <hi>Boner.</hi> With whom <hi>Boner</hi> after much communication, and conference of his Chaplens with maiſter <hi>Hawkes,</hi> hee remained at Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham: and the B. the next day departed to London, and came home againe at night.</p>

               <p>The firſt day of Iuly, the B. did call him himſelfe from the Porters lodge, and commanded him to prepare himſelfe to priſon: and ſo was hee ſent to bée kept cloſe priſoner in the gate houſe, where he remayned thirtéene daies: and then ſent <hi>Boner</hi> two men to know how he did, and whether hée were the ſame man. To whom he anſwered conſtantly for the trueth. After which anſwere, he heard no more of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, till the <hi>3.</hi> of September: on which day he was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately examined againe of <hi>Boner,</hi> and woulde haue had

               <p>After theſe priuate conferences, perſwaſions, and long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batings, M. <hi>Hawkes</hi> was cited to appeare in the B. conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie the viij. of February: &amp; again the ix.

                  </note> was ſometimes maiſter of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke hall in Cambridge: afterward was made Chaplen to king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and promoted by him to be biſhop of Rocheſter: and from thence in king <hi>Edwards</hi> daies tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to London.

               <p>Maiſter <hi>Latimer</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M.

                  </note> But eſpecially he could not abide Maſter <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde,</hi> Diuinitie Reader there. But M. <hi>Bilney</hi> had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his blinde zeale: and after a time came to <hi>Latimers</hi> ſtudie, and deſired him to heare him make his confeſſion. In hearing whereof he was ſo touched, that thereupon he lefte his Schoole diuinitie, and grewe in further knowledge of the trueth.</p>
               <p>After he came to the knowledge of the trueth he feruent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced the ſame, and ſuffered with patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictes therefore. He had eſpeciall enemies in Cambridge, a

               <p>At the laſt came D. <hi>Weſt,</hi> Biſhop of Ely, who (preaching againſt <hi>Latimer</hi> at Barnewel Abbey) forbad him to preach any more within the churches of the Vniuerſitie. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, D. <hi>Barnes,</hi> Prior of the Auguſtine Friers, did li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence Maſter <hi>Latimer</hi> to preach in his Church of the Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Friers: and he himſelfe preached at the Church by, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Saint Edwardes: which was the firſt Sermon of the Goſpel that D. <hi>Barnes</hi> preached, being vpon Chriſtmaſſe euen, vpon a Sunday. Whereupon, Articles were gathered out againſt him by M. <hi>Tirrel,</hi> Felow of the Kings Hall: and preſented to the Cardinall. Notwithſtanding the enemies that <hi>Latimer</hi> had in Cambridge, hee continued preaching there thrée yeres, and kept conference with Maſter <hi>Bilney.</hi> So that the place where they vſed moſt to walke in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fields, was commonly called the Heretikes hill.</p>
               <p>After he had trauelled in preaching thrée yeres in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, at length he was called vp to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cardinall for hereſie, &amp; being contented to ſubſcribe to ſuch Articles as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto him, was diſmiſſed. After this, by the meanes of Doctor <hi>Buttes,</hi> a great fauourer of good men,<note place="margin">D. <hi>Buttes</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourer of good men.</note> he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the number of thoſe that laboured in the Kinges Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, and went to the Court: where, after a ſpace, hee obteined a Benefice in Wiltſhire, in a towne called Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kington. So he left the Court, &amp; there kept reſidence. There he alſo found enemies, as in the Vniuerſitie, that drew ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles

His chéefe enemies (beſides the Prieſtes of the Countrey) were Doctor <hi>Powel</hi> of Saleſbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: Doctor <hi>Wilſon,</hi> ſometime of Cambridge: Maſter <hi>Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berden:</hi> and Doctor <hi>Sherewood.</hi> By whoſe meanes he was cited vp to <hi>W.

Being called before them, in the end he was diſmiſſed: on what condition it is vncertain. At length, through the procurement of D. <hi>Buttes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> he was aduaunced by the king to be B. of Worceſter. Who (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> holy bread, and holy water ſhould be miniſtred) cauſed theſe verſes to be pronounced to the people in his dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:<note place="margin">Verſes of <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> at the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of holy bread and holie water.</note>

               </p>
               <p>In his Biſhoprick alſo he ſuffered much trouble for wel doing, but the king greatly fauoured him. He continued in his biſhoprick til the time of the vi. articles. At which time, of his own accord he reſigned it. At which time alſo, <hi>Shaxto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> B. of Saliſburie, reſigned his biſhoprick. So they kept ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce til the time of K. <hi>Edward.</hi> And comming vp to London, for cure of a bruiſe, which he receiued by a fall from a Trée, hée was moleſted, and caſt into the Tower, til the time of king <hi>Ed.</hi> In whoſe dayes he was ſet frée, and preached againe, with great fruite and edification of the people.

He euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that the preaching of the Goſpel would coſte him his life: and perſwaded himſelfe that Wincheſter was kept in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2659:342"/> the Tower for the ſame purpoſe: as the Euent did truly prooue. For after the death of K. <hi>Edward</hi> he was ſent for by a purſeuant: of whoſe comming he had intelligence by <hi>Iohn Careles,</hi> &amp; prepared himſelf before to go with him. The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuant when he had deliuered his letters to him, departed, affirming that he had commandement not to tarrie for him, whereby it ſhould appeare they would haue had him fledde the realme, but he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vp to London, &amp; paſſing through Smithfield, (where merely hée ſaid that Smithfield had long groaned for him<note place="margin">Smithfield had long groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for M. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer.</hi>
                  </note>) was brought before the Counſel. Of whom he was againe caſt into the Tower, where he was hardly vſed, yet bare it cherefully, for when the Lieftena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts man vpon a time came to him: the aged father kept without fire in froſty weather, &amp; welnigh ſterued for cold, he merily had the man tel his maſter, that if he did not looke the better to him, perchance he would deceiue him.

               <p>With that, went hee to the ſtake, kneeled downe by it, kyſſed it, and moſt effectually prayed: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynde hym kneeled Maiſter <hi>Latimer,</hi> as earneſtly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vppon GOD as hee.

               <p>The xiij. of December died <hi>William Wiſeman</hi> in the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards Tower, a Clothwoorker of London. Some thought that through famine, or other euill handling, hee was made away. After his death he was throwen into the fields, and charge geuen that none ſhould burie him.

So he was had againe to the Colehouſe, where he had other ſixe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of the ſame affliction.</p>
               <p>He was examined in all <hi>14.</hi> ſeuerall times: the fourth time in the Archdeacons houſe of London in the moneth of October, before the Byſhops of London, Bath, Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Gloceſter: with whom after diſpute, of the church of Rome and authoritie therof, he was againe diſmiſſed.</p>
               <p>The Byſhops roſe vp and conſulted together, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a writing to be made, whertoo they put their handes. So he was againe carried to his Colehouſe M. <hi>Philpot</hi> thought then they conſpired his death.</p>
               <p>The <hi>5.</hi> examination was before the Byſhops of London, Rocheſter, Couentrie, ſaint Aſſes, with another.

               <p>After much diſpute of the Romiſh church, and reuilings of Doctor <hi>Storie</hi> againſt Maiſter <hi>Philpot,</hi> he was had againe to the Colehouſe, the Byſhop of London promiſing him fauour, and that he had in his hands to do him good. To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Philpot</hi> anſwered: my Lord, the pleaſure that I will

               <p>The ſixt examination was before the Lord Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berlaine, the vicont Hereford: the L. <hi>Ritch,</hi> the L.S.

The Lordes temporall being halfe amazed at that which they heard, and not giuing M. <hi>Philpot</hi> an euill word.</p>
               <p>The vij. examination was had the xix. of Nouember, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the B of London, and Rocheſter, the Chauncellor of Litchfield, and Doctor <hi>Chadſey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next morning <hi>Boner</hi> ſent for maiſter <hi>Philpot</hi> to come to Maſſe.<note place="margin">A ſharpe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> meſſage.</note> To whoſe meſſenger he anſwered, his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke was too weake to digeſt ſuch raw meates of fleſh, blood and bone.</p>
               <p>The next day the B. ſent againe for him, and miniſtred falſe articles againſt him, and could bring no witneſſe: but would haue had his priſon fellows ſworne againſt him. Which becauſe they refuſed, they were put in the ſtockes, and alſo M. <hi>Philpot</hi> with them, where they ſate from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning till night.</p>
               <p>The Sunday after at night betwixt <hi>8.</hi> and <hi>9.</hi> the Byſhop came to the Colehouſe himſelfe, and cauſed maiſter <hi>Philpot</hi> to be had into another place of impriſonment, and there cauſed him to be ſearched, but the ſearcher miſſed of his laſt examination which he had written: yet tooke two Letters from him whiche were of no greate impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce.</p>
               <p>The viij. examination was before the B. of London, of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2659:347"/> Saint Dauis, maiſter <hi>Mordant</hi> and others in the B. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: where the B. would haue had him anſwered onely, yea, or nay to certaine Articles. Which <hi>Philpot</hi> would not, but made his appeale: which the Biſhop ſaid he would ſtay in his owne handes. So was he had againe to the cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>9.</hi> time he was examined of the B. alone with his Chaplains: the next day after in the Wardrope. Where maiſter <hi>Philpot</hi> woulde not heare ſo much as Articles read againſt him: refuſing <hi>Boner</hi> as béeing not his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. At the laſt, they fell to reaſon of the Sacrament of the altar, and the maſſe: the Biſhop and diuers of his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines ſetting vpon maiſter <hi>Philpot.</hi> To whom hée gaue no place nor cauſe of triumph: but ſufficiently mainteined the trueth therein. So for that time he was diſmiſſed to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againe.</p>
               <p>And the next day the tenth time was examined of the B, his regiſter and others: and charged with the booke of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, made in king <hi>Edwards</hi> daies, and certain conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions agréed vpon both in Oxford and Cambridge, &amp;c. But M. <hi>Philpot</hi> refuſed him for ordinary, &amp; would not anſwere: but appealed to him that was in place of the Archbiſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke of Canterbury, becauſe he knew not of his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who was then Archbiſhop.</p>
               <p>The <hi>11.</hi> examination was on S. <hi>Andrewes</hi> day before the Biſh. of Dureſme, of Chicheſter, of Bath, of London: the Prolocutor maiſter <hi>Chriſtophorſon,</hi> Doctor <hi>Chadſey,</hi> maiſter <hi>Morgan</hi> of Oxford, maiſter <hi>Huſſey</hi> of the Arches, Doctor <hi>Weſton,</hi> Doctor <hi>Harpesfield,</hi> maiſter <hi>Cooſins,</hi> mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Iohnſon,</hi> regiſter to the B. of London: theſe diſputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt maiſter <hi>Philpot</hi> touching the true Church, and of the Sacrament of the Altar, and of the antiquity of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which maiſter <hi>Philpot</hi> profeſſed. Of which companie maiſter <hi>Morgan</hi> behaued himſelfe aboue all the reſt, moſt inſolently againſt him: who aſked maiſter <hi>Philpot</hi> howe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2659:348"/> hée knew that hée had the ſpirite of GOD, ſcoffingly. To whome <hi>Philpot</hi> aunſwered: by the faith of Chriſt which is in mée: Ah by faith, doe you ſo, ſayth <hi>Morgan?</hi> I weene it bee the ſpirite of the buttery, which your fellowes haue had, which haue beene burned before you: who were drunken the night before they went to their death: and I weene went drunke vnto it. To whome Maiſter <hi>Philpot</hi> aunſwered: It appeareth by your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, that you are better acquaynted with the ſpirite of the the butterie,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Philpots</hi> zeale againſt <hi>Morgan.</hi>
                  </note> then with the ſpirite of God. Wherefore I muſt needes tell thee thou paynted wall, and Hypocrite: In the name of the liuing GOD, whoſe trueth I haue tolde thee, that God ſhall raigne fire and brimſtone vppon ſuche ſcorners of his worde, and Blaſphemers of his trueth as thou art. <hi>Morgan,</hi> What, you rage nowe. <hi>Philpot.</hi> Thy fooliſhe blaſphemies haue compelled the ſpirite of God which is in mée, to ſpeake that which I haue ſaide vnto thee thou enemie of all righteouſneſſe. By thine owne wordes doe I iudge thée, thou blinde and blaſphemous Doctour, for as it is written: By thy words thou ſhalt be iuſtified, &amp; by thy wordes thou ſhalt be condemned. I haue ſpoken on Gods behalfe, and nowe haue I done with thée <hi>Morgan.</hi> Why then, I tell thée <hi>Philpot</hi> thou art an heretike, and ſhalt bée burned for thine hereſie, and afterwarde goe to hell fire. <hi>Philpot:</hi> I tell thee thou hypocrite, I paſſe not this for thy fire and fagot, neyther (I thanke GOD my Lorde) ſtande in feare of the ſame: my fayth in Chriſt ſhall ouercome them, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In fine, <hi>Chadſey</hi> perſwaded him to conſider of himſelfe, and to be wel aduiſed. To whom M. <hi>Philpot</hi> ſaid, he would his burning day were to morow: for this delay, (ſaid he) is euery day to die, &amp; yet not to be dead. So for that time they diſmiſſed him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>12.</hi> examination was on Wedneſday the fourth
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2659:348"/> of December before the Biſhop of London, Worceſter, &amp; Bangor. After Maſſe the Byſhop called him before him into his Chappell, and recited the Articles, which often tymes he had done before, with depoſitions of witneſſes, of whom ſome were not examined. <hi>Philpot</hi> againe refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him for Iudge.</p>
               <p>So he was had away, and anone after he was called for to come before him, &amp; the Byſhop of Bangor. Who being before them, they cauilled with him, where his religion was an hundreth yeare ago, accuſing him of ſingularitie &amp;c. and ſo diſmiſſed him til after noone. At which time he appeared againe, and after reaſoning with him touching the reall preſence: they againe diſmiſſed him till Thurſday after, which was the <hi>13.</hi> examination. On which day he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the Archb. of Yorke, and other Biſhops, as the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Chicheſter, Bathe, London, &amp;c &amp; they reaſoned with him touching the true Church, and the authority thereof, and vniuerſality. But being not able to deale or preuayle with him in ſtrength of argument, nor verity of their cauſe, they departed.</p>
               <p>The ſame day at night againe, <hi>Boner</hi> called for him, and required him to ſay directly, whether he would be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable or not. To whom he anſwered, that he required a ſure proofe of that Church whereto <hi>Boner</hi> called him: which when <hi>Boner</hi> could not prooue, they gaue him ouer vntil the xiij. or xiiij. daye of December. On which dayes the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſitting iudicially in his Conſiſtorie at Paules, cauſed him to be brought thither before him and others, and obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him <hi>3.</hi> articles. <hi>1.</hi> That he refuſed to be reconciled to the Church. <hi>2.</hi> That he had blaſphemed the maſſe,<note place="margin">Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt M. <hi>Philpot.</hi>
                  </note> and called it Idolatrie. <hi>3.</hi> That he denied the reall preſence. And exhorted him to recant, and to returne to his Romiſh Church.</p>
               <p>Whereto when M. <hi>Philpot</hi> had ſhewed that he was not out of the church, &amp; that he had not ſpoken againſt the maſſe,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:2659:349"/> nor ſacrament of the Altar. He was once againe diſmiſſed till the ſixtéenth day of the ſame moneth: on which day when neither threatninges, nor faire allurementes could mooue him. The B. after he had brought foorth a certaine inſtrument containing articles and queſtions, agréed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon both in Oxforde and Cambridge: and had exhibited two bookes in print: the one the Catechiſme made in King <hi>Edwardes</hi> dayes, <hi>anno. 1552.</hi> The other concerning the true reporte of the diſputation in the Conuocation houſe, which <hi>Philpot</hi> acknowledged to bée his penning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any iuſt cauſe he could pretend againſt him by forme of lawe,<note place="margin">

                  </note> procéeded to his tyrannical ſentence of condemnation. &amp; ſo commited him to the Sheriffe: whoſe officers led him away. And in <hi>Pater noſter</hi> row, his ſeruaunt méeting him, lamented: to whom <hi>Philpot</hi> ſaid, content thy ſelfe, I ſhal do well ynough, thou ſhalt ſée me againe. So the officers had maiſter <hi>Philpot</hi> to Newgate: whom <hi>Alexander</hi> the kéeper vſed very rigorouſly, and would not ſtrike off his yrons vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foure pound, but put him in <hi>Limbo.</hi> Whereof the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe vnderſtanding, cauſed <hi>Alexander</hi> to vſe him more gently.</p>
               <p>Vpon Tueſday at ſupper, being the <hi>17.</hi> of December, he had worde from the Sheriffe to prepare himſelfe: for the next day he ſhould be burned. Maiſter <hi>Philpot</hi> anſwered, and ſaid: I am readie, God graunt me ſtrength, and a ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reſurrection. In the morning, the ſherifes came about viij. of the clocke, and called for him, and hee moſt ioyfully came down vnto them, When he was entred into Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, becauſe the way was foule, two Officers tooke him vp, to bear him to the ſtake. To whom he ſaid merily: what? will you make me a Pope? I am content to goe vnto my Iourneyes ende on my feete. But firſt comming to Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fielde,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Philpot</hi> payeth his vowes in Smithfield.</note> hée there knéeled downe vpon his knées, ſaying with a loude voice theſe wordes.

                  <hi>Thomas Whittle</hi> was apprehended by one <hi>Edmund A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labaſter,</hi> and caried to the Biſhop of Wincheſter lying ſick, hoping to be preferred for his diligence: but the Biſhop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed him.

               <p>The next day after was <hi>Bartlet Greene</hi> condemned. He had béene Student in Oxford, and there by hearing the lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Peter Martir,</hi> hee came to haue knowledge of the trueth. Afterward he was Student of the common lawes in the Temple.</p>

This Maſter <hi>Greene</hi> confeſſed that he had ſayde.

                  <p>Thus after they had aſked him many friuolous queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they cited him to appeare before the Pope, at Rome, within fourtie daies.

                  <p>The Popes definitiue Letter was dated about the firſte of Ianuarie, and deliuered here about the middeſt of Februarie.

By which dealing the Archbyſhop began to ſuſpect more and more what they went about.</p>
                  <p>Afterward came to him the Spaniſh Frier bringing, a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with articles, which <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſhould openly profeſſe in his recantatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before the people, earneſtly deſiring him that he would write the ſame inſtrument with the articles with his own ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; ſigne it with his name.

In which, he declared cauſes why iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Quéene had determined his death: for that he was a Traitor, and an heretike, &amp;c. And that it ſéemed méete ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawe of equality, that as the death of the Duke of Northumberland made euen with <hi>Tho. Moore,</hi>

                     <hi>Iulius Palmer</hi> was ſometime a Student and felow of Magdalen Colledge in Oxford, and afterward Schoolemaſter in the Towne of Reding. He was borne in Couentrée, and before his calling to the knowledge of the trueth, a great aduerſarie to the Goſpel, and a contemner of the miniſters of the trueth.

And at length grew vp in ſuch ripenes of the trueth, that he ſpared not to declare certaine ſparkes thereof in his outward behauiour and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Wherefore, being abhorred of diuers (eſpecially of M. <hi>Cole,</hi> the Preſident) which were before his friends: hée addreſſed himſelfe to depart the houſe. And being demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a friend of his, how he woulde liue, anſwered: The earth is the Lords, and the fulnes thereof. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>After the geuing ouer of his Felowſhip, he was placed by Patent, Schoolemaſter at Reding, and there was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of thoſe that feared God.

So being deſtitute of all worldly helpe, he aduiſed himſelfe to goe cloſely to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, there to receiue his quarters ſtipende, which he lefte vnreceiued at his departure, and to conuey from thence his ſtuffe.

Where tenne dayes he hanged by the handes and féete, ſo high, that welnéere no part of his bodie touched the ground.</p>
                  <p>After all this, hee was brought before the Mayor of Reading, and there thoſe falſe Brethren which before had robbed his ſtudie, obiected againſt him, Treaſon, Sedition, Murther, and Adulterie, &amp;c.

                  <p>Wherefore once againe he was called out of pryſon, and appeared before the Mayor, and <hi>Byrd</hi> the officiall, and two other Iuſtices, to render an accompt of his faith.

So he was ſent to Newbery, and came thether on the Munday at night, and with him <hi>Thomas Askins</hi> his felow priſoner, where they found <hi>Iohn Grome</hi> their faithfull brother in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>So the xv. of Iuly the pryſoners appeared before Doctor <hi>Geffery</hi> and other Commiſſioners, where after reaſoning of the authoritie and vniuerſalitie of the church of Rome, and of the preſence in the Sacrament &amp;c. when no allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments nor perſwaſions would preuayle, they were all thrée condemned and burned together.</p>

                  <p>But the other two made their prayers ſecretly to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, all thrée falling to the ground: and as <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> beganne to riſe, there came behind him a popiſh prieſt, exhorting him to recant, to whome <hi>Palmer</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Palmer</hi> was about 24. yeares old when he ſuffered.

               <p>About thrée of the clocke in the morning, Sathan began to trouble her with doubt of her ſaluation:<note place="margin">Satan trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the martyr.</note> in which doubt by thoſe that were with her, ſhée receiued great comfort, and aſſurance.</p>

               <p>Of the ſixe of that companie which eſcaped burning, two were ſcourged by Biſhoppe <hi>Boner</hi> in his Garden, <hi>Thomas Hinſhawe,</hi> about the age of ninetéene or twentie yeares, being Apprentice, and dwelling in Paules Churchyarde with one M. <hi>Puggeſon,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Milles,</hi> a married man: on whom he ſpent two roddes, and on <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> one. <hi>Hinſhaw</hi> was deliuered by reaſon he fell ſicke of a burning ague (<hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> not thinking he would liue) when he had béene a yere in priſon.

               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn Milles</hi> was a Capper, a right faithfull ſeruant of God.

               <p>
                  <hi>Boner</hi> (ofttimes ſpeaking to <hi>Iohn Milles</hi>) would ſay, they call me bloudie <hi>Boner:</hi> a vengeance on you all, I would fain be rid of you, but you haue a delight in burning: but if I might haue my will, I would ſowe your mouthes, and put you into ſackes, and drowne you.</p>

                  <hi>Anno Domini,</hi> one thouſande, fiue hundred, and thrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, <hi>Marke Burges,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Burges.</note> an Engliſhman, Maſter of an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Ship, called the Minion, was burned in Liſhborne, a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in Portugall, and <hi>Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hooke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">W. Hooke.</note> of the age of xvi. yeres, ſtoned to death by certaine young men of Ciuill, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his faith,</p>
               <p>As the moſt were burned and tormented to death, ſo ſome were torne with ſcourging, as, <hi>Richard Wylmot,</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Fairefaxe,</hi> both whipped in Drapers hall, through the crueltie of <hi>Brookes,</hi> then Maſter of the Companie. That <hi>Wylmot</hi> could not lie in his bed vi. nights after: and neither of them enioyed health after.</p>
               <p>They were thus ſcourged for ſaying, they were ſory for D. <hi>Cromes</hi> recantation.</p>
               <p>After theſe two, was one <hi>Green</hi> ſcourged becauſe he had a booke, called <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> and woulde not bewraye more matter, to their minde. He was accuſed by his Maſter, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Iohn Waylande,</hi> a Printer, and brought before Doctor <hi>Storie:</hi> by whom (after long ſtocking, and euill vſage in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) he was adiudged to be whipped. Which was performed vpon him in the preſence of Doctor <hi>Storie,</hi> in Chriſtes Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall.</p>
               <p>Alſo, <hi>Steeuen Cotton,</hi> burned (as before) at Brainforde, was twiſe beaten by <hi>Boner,</hi> Likewiſe was <hi>Iames Harris</hi> of Byllerica in Eſſex, ſcourged by <hi>Boner,</hi> in his garden.

               <p>With theſe alſo is to be numbred a poore Beggar, which was whihped at Saliſburie, after hee had béene put into a Dungeon, becauſe he would not receiue the Sacrament at Eaſter, in the towne of Colingborowe.</p>
               <p>As ſome were tried by burning, racking, and ſcourging, ſo vpon other ſome the Lorde did lay a lighter hande of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, as vpon <hi>William Liuing</hi> and his wife, in the citie of London, <hi>Iohn Lythall, Elizabeth Yong,</hi> and <hi>William
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2659:387"/> Wats</hi> of Tunbridge, who fled away, his kéepers beyng tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled and fallen aſléepe. <hi>Alexander Winſhurſt</hi> a prieſt that eſcaped by negligence of <hi>Cluny,</hi> who left none at home to kéepe him faſt, in whoſe houſe he was priſoner, <hi>Boſomes</hi> wife: the Lady <hi>Kneuet</hi> of Northfolke, towards an hundred yéeres old: the Lady <hi>Vane,</hi> who with much trouble, yet paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe terrible daies with life.</p>
               <p>In the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, <hi>Anno 1546.</hi> there was one <hi>Iohn Dauis</hi> a childe of twelue yéeres old,<note place="margin">

               <p>Likewiſe Miſtris <hi>Roberts</hi> by Gods prouidence eſcaped daunger, dwelling in Hawkhurſt in Suſſex, Miſtris <hi>Anne Lucie</hi> of Nottingham, &amp;c. Likewiſe a congregation at Stoke in Suffolke was deliuered by Gods mercifull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, but eſpecially that of London was diuerſe times in perill, and alwayes was preſerued of God: in which congregation were ſometimes fortie,<note place="margin">The congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don.</note> ſometimes an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, ſometimes two hundreth, ſometimes mo, ſometimes leſſe. About the latter end of Quéene <hi>Mary</hi> it greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. From the firſt beginning, which was about the firſt entrie of Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> raigne, they had diuerſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: Firſt Maiſter <hi>Scamler,</hi> then <hi>Thomas Foule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The miniſters of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</note> after him Maiſter <hi>Rough,</hi> then Maiſter <hi>Auguſtine Benher,</hi> and laſt Maiſter <hi>Bentham:</hi> who likewiſe was by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence wonderfully preſerued.</p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:2659:388"/>
               <p>Likewiſe at Calis few there were of the profeſſors of the goſpell that miſcaried: eſpecially <hi>Iohn Thorpe</hi> and his wife were mercifully preſerued and ſuccored of ſtraungers. To theſe are to be added <hi>Edward Benet, Ieffery Hurſt,</hi> in the towne of Shakerley in Lankeſhire, who were ſaued by the death of Quéene <hi>Mary. William Wood</hi> of Kent of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of Strowd, who was deliuered by the diſagréement of <hi>Kennall</hi> and <hi>Chadſey,</hi> two popiſh Doctors that examined him, as <hi>Paule</hi> was deliuered by the contention of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeis and Saduces.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe was <hi>Symon Greeuens</hi> mercifully deliuered, beyng at the aſſembly held at Spire, and complained of to the king by <hi>Faber,</hi> the B. of Vienna, whom he had gently reprooued for maintaining certaine errours in his Sermon which he had there preached.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the Lady Katherine dutches of Suffolke hardly eſcaped, and paſſed the ſeas into Germany, where ſhe ſuffered the afflictions of a ſtraunger in another land.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Th. Sprat,</hi> and <hi>William Porredge</hi> eſcaped very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly perſecution by M. <hi>Brent</hi> Iuſtice in Kent, and the two <hi>Blachendines. Iohn Cornet</hi> prentiſe with a minſtrell, was onely whipped by the commaundement of the Earle of Oxford, and baniſhed the towne of Roughedge.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe <hi>Thomas Brice</hi> profeſſor of the goſpell hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcaped the bloudie hands of the tyraunts. To thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayd are to be added, <hi>Gertrude Crockhey</hi> of S.

                  <p>After this, it happened immediatly vpon the riſing of Sir <hi>Thomas Wiat,</hi> that the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Courtney,</hi> were charged with falſe ſuſpition of Syr <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Wyats</hi> riſing.

It was ten of the clocke at night before they came, and they were ſo boiſterous, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being deſired to ſtay and come in the morning to ſpeake with her, they came haſtelie ruſhing into her Graces chamber, as ſoone as the Gentlewoman, that was to doe the meſſage fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to her. And comming in vnto her, they declared the Quéenes pleaſure, which was, that ſhe ſhoulde be at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the ſeuenth day of that preſent Moneth. Adding more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer vnto her, that their Commiſſion was ſuch, that they muſt néedes bring her with them, either quick or dead. And thereupon called for Phiſitions, Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Wendie,</hi> and demaunded of them whether ſhe might bée remoued from thence with life, or no. Whoſe anſwere was, that ſhe might.</p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:2659:390"/>
                  <p>So in concluſion they willed her to prepare againſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at ix of the clock, to goe with them.</p>
                  <p>On the morrow (at the time preſcribed) they had her foorth as ſhe was, very faint and féeble, and in ſuch weake caſe, that ſhe was readie to ſowne thrée or foure times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them.</p>
                  <p>So (all ſicke in the Litter) ſhe came to Redborne, where ſhe was garded all night. From thence to Saint Albons, to Sir <hi>Rafe Rowlets</hi> houſe, where ſhe taried that night, both féeble in bodie, and comfortleſſe in minde. From that place they paſſed to Maſter <hi>Doddes</hi> houſe at Mimmes. Where alſo they remayned that night. And ſo from thence ſhe came to Highgate: where (being very ſick) ſhe taried that night, and the next day. From that place ſhe was conueyed to the Court.</p>
                  <p>Now when ſhe came to the Court, her Grace was there ſtraightway ſhutte vp, and kept as cloſe Priſoner the ſpace of a fortnight: which was, till Palme-ſunday, ſéeing ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King, nor Quéene, nor Lorde, nor friende, in all that time, but onelie the Lorde Chamberlayne, Sir <hi>Ioh.

                  <p>The Friday before Palme-ſunday, the Biſhop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, with ninetéene of the Counſel, came vnto her grace,<note place="margin">L. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> falſly accuſed.</note> from the Quéene, &amp; burdened her with <hi>Wiates</hi> conſpiracie, and charged her alſo with the buſineſſe made by Sir <hi>Peter Carewe,</hi> and the reſt of the Gentlemen of the Weſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.

                  <p>In concluſion, they declared vnto her, that it was the Quéenes pleaſure ſhe ſhould goe to the Tower, vntill the matter were further examined, and then they departed.</p>
                  <p>Within the ſpace of an houre, or little more, came foure Lordes of the Counſell, which were, the Lorde Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, the Biſhoppe of Wincheſter, the Lorde Stewarde,

                     </note> al in white coates, wayting about the gardens all that night, and likewiſe two Lordes watching there alſo with their bands and companie.</p>
                  <p>Vpon Saterday folowing, two Lords of the Counſel (the one was the Earle of Suſſex) came and certified her grace, that forthwith ſhe muſt goe vnto the Tower.</p>
                  <p>The barge being prepared for her, and the tide now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, in heauie moode her Grace requeſted the Lords, that ſhe might tary another tide. But one of them replied, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tide nor time was to be delayed.</p>
                  <p>And when her Grace requeſted that ſhe might write to the Quéene, he made anſwere, he durſt not permitte that. But the other Lorde, the Earle of Suſſex, knéeling downe, tolde her Grace that ſhee ſhoulde haue libertie to write, and as he was a true man, he woulde deliuer it to the Quéenes Maieſtie, and bring her Grace an anſwere thereof againe, whatſoeuer came thereof.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon (being not permitted to ſpeake with the Quéene) ſhe wrote vnto her Maieſtie. On Palmeſunday about nine of the clocke, thoſe two Lordes returned again, declaring, that it was time for her grace to depart. So ſhée tooke her Barge with the two Lordes, thrée of the Quéenes Gentlewomen, and thrée of her owne, her Gentleman Vſher, and two of her Groomes, lying, and hoouering a certaine ſpace vpon the water, becauſe it was yet dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for them to ſhoote the Bridge. At the length, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the ſtaires, when ſhe la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and comming out of the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:2659:391"/> barge, hauing one foote vpon the ſtaiers. Here landeth (ſaid ſhe) as true a ſubiect being priſoner,<note place="margin">The Lady <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> had none other friends but God.</note> as euer landed at theſe ſtayers: and before thée O God I ſpeake it, hauing none other fréends but thée alone. After ſhée came to the Tower &amp; was impryſoned, the doores were bolted, and forted vppon her.<note place="margin">Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> priſoned in the Tower.</note> At which time ſhée called to her Gentlewoman for her booke: deſiring God not to ſuffer her to buylde her foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation vppon the ſandes, but vppon the rocke: whereby all blaſtes of bluſtering weather ſhould haue no power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her.</p>
                  <p>Within fiue daies after commeth <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> the ruler of the roſt, with diuerſe other of the Counſaile, and examined her of the talke that was at Aſhridge betwixt her and Sir <hi>Iames a Croft,</hi> concerning her remouing thence to Dunnington caſtle.</p>
                  <p>To whom ſhe ſaid, ſhe remembred that M. <hi>Hobby</hi> and her Officers, and Sir <hi>Iames a Croft</hi> had ſuch wordes: but what is that to the purpoſe, my Lord (ſaid ſhee) but that I may goe to mine owne houſes at all times.</p>
                  <p>That day or there about, diuers of her owne Officers brought prouiſion for her meate: offering, and making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to the Lord Chamberlaine, Conſtable of the Tower, they might ſerue the ſame. Whoſe requeſt, he with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and threatnings refuſed, ſaying: for that ſhée is a priſoner, ſhe ſhould be ſerued with none other, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Liefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants men.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this occaſion, her graces officers made ſute vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Counſaile, that ſome might be appointed to bring her diet vnto her: which was graunted, and thereupon were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed one of her Gentlemen, the Clark of her kitchen, and her two purueyors, to bring in her prouiſion once in a day. And vpon the ſame ſute of her Officers, were appointed to waite vpon her Grace, two Yeomen of her Chamber, one of her Robes, two of her Pantrie, and Ewrie, one of her Butterie, and another of her Sellar, and likewiſe, two of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:2659:392"/> her kitchen, and one of her larder: all which continued with her the time of her trouble.</p>
                  <p>After this ſort hauing lien a whole moneth there in cloſe priſon, and beyng very euill at eaſe, ſhe deſired of the Lord Chamberlaine, and the Lord <hi>Shandoys,</hi> that ſhe might haue libertie to walke in ſome other place, becauſe ſhe felt not her ſelfe well at eaſe. This requeſt could not be granted till the next day the Lord <hi>Shandoys</hi> had obtained of the Counſaile, that ſhe might walke into the Quéenes lodgings: ſo that he and the Lord Chamberlaine, and thrée of the Quéenes gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen did accompany her, the windowes being ſhut, and ſhe not ſuffered to looke out at any of them.</p>
                  <p>Afterward there was libertie graunted her to walke in a little garden, the doores and gates ſhutte. At which times of her walking there, the Priſoners on that ſide were ſtraightly commaunded not to ſpeake or looke out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the garden, till her Grace were gone away: hauing to that purpoſe their kéepers to waite vppon them for that time.</p>

                     </note>During this time, there vſed a little boy, a mans child of the tower, to bring her Grace flowers: who was forbidden any more to do ſo by the Lord Chamberlaine.</p>
                  <p>The next day as ſhe was walking in the garden, the childe peeping in at a hole in the doore, ſaide vnto her, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, I can bring you no more flowers. Whereat ſhée ſmyled, vnderſtanding thereby what they had done.</p>
                  <p>The fifth day of May the Conſtable was diſcharged of his office in the Tower, and one Sir <hi>Henrie Benefield</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sir</hi> Henrie Benefield.</note> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in his roome. He brought with him an hundred Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in blewe cotes, which did much amaze her: ſo that ſhee aſked, whether he were of that conſcience or no, that if her murdering were ſecretely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to his charge he would ſée the execution thereof. They perſwaded her, that God would not ſuffer ſuch wickedneſſe to procéede: ſaying, they knew not what maner of man he was. Well (quoth ſhee)
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:2659:392"/> God grant it be not ſo: for thou O God canſt mollifie all ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nous harts, &amp; diſapoint al ſuch cruell purpoſes, &amp; I beſéech thée heare me thy creature, which am thy ſeruant, &amp; at thy commandement, truſting by thy grace euer ſo to remaine.</p>
                  <p>On Trinitie Sunday being the <hi>19.</hi> of May, ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued from the Tower, the Lord Treaſuror beyng then there for the loading of the cartes, and diſcharging the place of the ſame: where ſir <hi>Henry Benefield,</hi> (being appointed her gailor) did receiue her with a company of rakehels to garde her, beſides the Lord of Darbies band, vnto whom at length came the Lord of Tame ioyned in Commiſſion with ſir <hi>Henry,</hi> for the ſafegarding of her perſon,<note place="margin">Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> to Wood<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtocke.</note> and they toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conueyed her grace to Woodſtocke.</p>
                  <p>The firſt day they conducted her to Richmond, where ſhe continued al night, beyng reſtrained of her owne men: and <hi>Benefields</hi> ſouldiers appointed in their roomes, on which night ſhe looked for none other but to haue béene murthered,<note place="margin">Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> in great feare.</note> and paſſed the ſame night in great feare.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards paſſing ouer the water at Richmond, going towards Windſore, her grace eſpied certaine of her poore ſeruants ſtanding on the other ſide, who were very deſirous to ſée her: whom when ſhée beheld, turning to one of her men ſtanding by (ſhée ſaid) yoonder I ſée certaine of my men, go to them, and ſay theſe wordes, <hi>Tanquam ouis.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quam ouis.</note> So paſſing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that night, ſhe was lodged at Windſore at the deanes houſe. From thence ſhe was garded the next night to Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Dormers</hi> houſe.</p>
                  <p>On the morrow her grace paſſing from M. <hi>Dormer</hi> (where was for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of her abode there, a ſtraight watch kept) ſhée came to the Lord of <hi>Tames</hi> houſe, where ſhée lay all the night, beyng very Princely entertayned both of Knights and Ladies, Gentlemen &amp; Gentlewomen: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at Sir <hi>Henry</hi> grunted, and was offended. Wherevnto the L. of Tame anſwered: that he was well aduiſed of his doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, being ioyned in Commiſſion aſwell as he: adding with
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:2659:393"/> warrantiſe that her grace ſhould bée merrie in his houſe.</p>
                  <p>The next day, as ſhe ſhould take her iourney towardes Woodſtocke, the Lord of Tame with another Gentleman being at tables playing, and dropping vie Crownes, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> paſſing by, ſtaied and ſaid ſhe would ſée the game out: which ſir <hi>Henry</hi> would ſcarſe permit.</p>
                  <p>After this ſir <hi>Henry</hi> went vp into a chamber, where was appointed for her grace a chayre, two cuſhions and a foote carpet very faire and princely, wherein preſumptuouſly he ſat,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Henry Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefield</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous &amp; vnciuill.</note> and called one <hi>Barwicke</hi> his man to pull of his bootes. When ſupper was doone, hée called my Lord, and willed him, that all the Gentlemen and Ladies ſhould withdraw themſelues, euery one to his lodgyng, maruelling much that hée would permit ſuch a company, conſidering ſo great a charge committed to him. Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> quoth my Lord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your ſelfe, all ſhall be voided, your men and all. Nay my Souldiors, quoth Sir <hi>Henry</hi> ſhall watch all night. The Lord of Thame anſwered, it ſhall not néede. Well ſaid hée, néede or néede not, they ſhall ſo doo.</p>
                  <p>The next day ſhe was carried to Woodſtocke, where ſhe was incloſed as before in the Tower of London.</p>
                  <p>At length ſhe had gardens appointed for her walke: but alwayes when ſhée did recreate her ſelfe therein, the doores were faſt locked vp, in as ſtraight manner as in the Tower, being at the leaſt <hi>5.</hi> or <hi>6.</hi> lockes betwéene her lodging &amp; her walkes: Sir <hi>Henry</hi> kéeping the keyes and truſting no man therewith. Wherefore ſhe called him her gailer.</p>
                  <p>After ſhe had bin at Woodſtocke a while, ſhe was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Counſell to write vnto the Q. and ſo ſhe did, ſir <hi>Henry</hi> alwaies at hand to obſerue what ſhe wrote: neither would he permit her letters to be carried, <hi>4.</hi> or <hi>5.</hi> daies after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> writing thereof, till at the laſt, he deliuered them to one of her Gentlemen. Then about the <hi>8.</hi> of Iune, came downe D. <hi>Owen,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Wendie</hi> to miniſter phiſicke to her, for that ſhe was ſickly. Whereof ſhe being amended, they
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2659:393"/> returned againe to the Court: making there good report to the Q. of her Graces behauiour, &amp; humblenes towards the Quéenes maieſty: which the Q. tooke very thankfully.</p>
                  <p>About this time, was there a great conſulting among the B. &amp; gentlemen-touching a marriage for her Grace. Which ſome of the Spaniards wiſhed to be with ſome ſtraunger, that ſhe might go out of the Realme with her portion.</p>
                  <p>A Lord being there, at the laſt ſaid, that the King ſhoulde neuer haue any quiet common wealth in England,<note place="margin">The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Lady <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                     </note> vnleſſe her head were ſtricken from her ſhoulders. Wherevnto the Spaniards anſwered, God forbid that their king, and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſhould haue that minde to conſent to ſuch a miſchiefe. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that day y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniards neuer left their good perſwaſions to the king, that the like honor he ſhould neuer obtaine, as he ſhould in deliuering the Lady <hi>Elizab.</hi> grace out of priſon.<note place="margin">L. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> deliuered out of priſon.</note> Wherby at length ſhe was happily releaſed from the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Herevppon, ſhortly after ſhee was ſent for to come to Hampton Court, from her comfortleſſe captiuitie in Wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocke, where ſhe was at ſundry times in great daunger of life: firſt through fire, which began to kindle, betwéene the boords, &amp; ſéelings vnder the Chamber where ſhe lay: done of purpoſe, as it was credibly thoght, of a knight who was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in commiſſion with Sir <hi>Hen.</hi> It was thought, and alſo was affirmed of one <hi>Paule Peny,</hi> a kéeper of Woodſtocke, a notorious ruffian, &amp; butcherly wretch, that he was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to kill the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who both ſaw the man oft in her ſight, and alſo knew thereof.</p>
                  <p>An other time, one of the priuie chamber, a great man about the Quéen, and chiefe dearling of <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> named maiſter <hi>Iames Baſſet,</hi> came to Blandebridge, a myle from Woodſtocke, with <hi>20.</hi> or <hi>30.</hi> priuy coates, and ſent for Sir <hi>Henrie</hi> to come and ſpeake with him. But ſo it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, a little before, Sir <hi>Henrie</hi> was ſent for by Poſt to the counſel, leauing ſtraight word behind him with his brother, that no man whatſoeuer he were, though comming with a
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:2659:394"/> bill of the Queenes hande, or any other warraunt, ſhould haue acceſſe to her before his returne againe. By reaſon whereof maiſter <hi>Benefields</hi> brother comming to him at the bridge,<note place="margin">God deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth L. <hi>Eliza.</hi>
                     </note> would ſuffer him in no caſe to approch nigh: who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe (as is ſuppoſed) was appoynted to murder the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Ladie.</p>
                  <p>Her Grace being in the Tower of London, a writ came downe, ſubſcribed with certaine hands of the Counſaile for her execution: but that God ſtirred vp maiſter <hi>Bridges</hi> the Lieftenaunt the ſame time of the Tower, to come in haſte to the Quéene, to giue certificate thereof, and to knowe further her conſent touching her ſiſters death. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon, the deuiſe (which was Wincheſters diuelliſh plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme) was diſappoynted. Moreouer, during her impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, one maiſter <hi>Edmund Tremanie</hi> was on the rack, and maiſter <hi>Smithwike,</hi> and diuers others in the Tower were examined, and diuers offers made them to accuſe the innocent Ladie. Which when ſhée heard of, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from Woodſtocke, ſhe wrote theſe verſes with her dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond in a glaſſe window. <hi>Much ſuſpected by me: nothing proued can be:</hi> quoth <hi>Elizabeth</hi> priſoner.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Elizabeth</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now departing from Wodſtocke, Sir <hi>Henrie</hi> and his ſouldiers, with the Lorde of Thame, and Syr <hi>Rafe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine</hi> garding her: the firſt night ſhee came to Rocet. In which iourney ſuch a mightie wynd did blow, that her ſeruantes were faine to hold downe her clothes about her: inſomuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her hood was twiſe or thriſe blown fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her head. Whereuppon, ſhee deſirous to returne to a Gentlemans houſe néere there, could not be ſuffered by Sir <hi>Henrie,</hi> but was conſtrayned (vnder an hedge) to trimme vp her head, ſo well as ſhe could.</p>
                  <p>After this, the next night they came to M <hi>Dormers,</hi> and ſo to Colbrooke, where ſhe lay all that night, at the <hi>George.</hi> On which night, all her men were taken from her, ſauing her Gentleman Vſher, thrée gentlewomen, two Groomes,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:2659:394"/> and one of her wardrobe: the ſouldiers watching &amp; warding about the houſe, and ſhe cloſe ſhut vp. This was, becauſe certaine of her Gentlemen and Yeomen (to the number of <hi>60.</hi>) came to méete her, and ſalute her.</p>
                  <p>The next day folowing, her Grace entred Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pton court, on the backſide, into the Princes lodging, the dores being ſhutte to her, and ſhe garded (as before) with Souldiers. Shée lay there a fortnight at the leaſt, before any body had recourſe vnto her. At the length came the Lorde <hi>William Howarde,</hi> who marueylous honourablie entertayned her. And not long after, came the Biſhoppe of Wincheſter, the Lorde of Arundell, the Lorde of Shrewſburie, and Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie <hi>Peter,</hi> whom ſhe required to be a meane for her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie out of priſon. <hi>S. Gardiner</hi> requeſted her to ſubmit her ſelf to the Quéene, and to craue pardon. Which ſhe ſaid, ſhée would not doe, hauing neuer offended: and that ſhe had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lie in priſon all the daies of her life: requiring lawe, if ſhe had offended.</p>
                  <p>The next day he came againe to her, and vſed perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to haue her acknowledge her ſelfe faultie. She againe refuſeth: adding, that it were as good for her to be in priſon with honeſtie and trueth, as abroade, ſuſpected of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie. And this that I haue ſaid, I wil (quoth ſhe) ſtand vnto, for I will neuer belie my ſelfe. So Wincheſter, and the reſt (knéeling downe) prayed that all might be forgotten: and ſo departed, leauing her faſt locked as before.</p>
                  <p>A ſeuennight after, the Quéene ſent for her Grace at ten of the cloke in the night, to ſpeake with her: for ſhe had not ſéene her in two yeres before. So Miſtreſſe <hi>Clarentius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her to the Quéenes bedchamber, where her Maieſty was. At the ſight of whom, her Grace knéeled downe, and deſired God to preſerue her Maieſtie: ſaying, ſhe miſtruſted not, but ſhe ſhould proue her ſelfe as good a Subiect to ward her Maieſtie, as euer did any. And deſired her Maieſtie euen ſo to iudge of her. To whom the Quéene anſwered, you
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:2659:395"/> will not confeſſe your offence, but ſtande ſtoutly to your trueth. I pray God it may fall out ſo. If it doe not (quoth the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) I requeſt neither fauour, nor pardon at your handes. Thus her Grace departing, went to her lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging againe, and the ſeuennight after, ſhee was releaſed of Sir <hi>Henry</hi> her Gaoler. And ſo (being ſette at libertie) ſhee went into the Countrey, and had appointed to goe with Sir <hi>Thomas Pope,</hi> a Counſeller, and one of the Quéenes Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen Vſhers.</p>
                  <p>Then there came to Lamheire, Maſter <hi>Iermingham,</hi> and maſter <hi>Norris,</hi> gentleman Vſher, Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> men, and tooke away from her Grace, Miſtres <hi>Aſhley</hi> to the Fléete, and thrée other of her gentlewomen, to the Tower.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after God tooke away <hi>Gard.</hi>

                     </note> her mortal enemy: and after him, other of her enemies dropped away, one after another: and her libertie ſtill increaſed, till at the length, in the Moneth of Nouember, &amp; the ſeuentéene day of the ſame, thrée yeres after the death of <hi>Gardiner,</hi> died Quéene <hi>Mary.</hi>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">Queene <hi>Marie</hi> dieth.</note> Of which Quéene this may truely be affirmed, that before her, was neuer read in ſtorie of any king or Quéen of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſince the time of king <hi>Lucius,</hi> vnder whom (in time of peace) by hanging, heading, burning, and impriſonment, ſo much Chriſtian bloud was ſpilled within this Realme, as was vnder the reigne of Quéene <hi>Marie,</hi> for the ſpace of iiij. yéeres to be ſéene.</p>

                  <p>It was decréed, according to the deſire of the papiſts, that it ſhould be in writing on both partes (for auoiding of much altercation of words) and each of them ſhould deliuer their writings to other, to conſider what were improued therein, and to declare the ſame againe in writing ſome other conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient day. This was agréed on of both parts. The Lords al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the parlement made means to her maieſty, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this conference might reade their aſſertions in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tongue, and that in the preſence of the nobility, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the parlement houſe, for the better ſatiſfaction, and the better enabling of their owne iudgements, to treate and conclude of ſuch lawes as might depend therevpon.</p>
                  <p>This was thought very reaſonable, and agréed vpon: the day being appointed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt of March, &amp; the place Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter church. Notwithſtanding this former order appointed, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſented vnto on both parts. The aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly being now made, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> B. of Wincheſter, &amp; his collegues, alleadging that they had
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:2659:397"/> miſtaken that their aſſertions and reaſons ſhould be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſo only recited out of a booke, ſaid that their booke was not then ready written, but they were ready to argue &amp; diſpute,<note place="margin">The Papiſts flee from the agreement.</note> and therefore they would for that time, repeate in ſpéech that which they had to ſay to the firſt probation.</p>
                  <p>This varying of theirs from the firſt order was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without any great refuſing, becauſe they excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with miſtaking the order, and agréed again that they would not faile, but put it in writing according to the former order, and deliuer it to the other part.</p>
                  <p>So the B. of Wincheſter. &amp; his Colleagues appointed D. <hi>Cole,</hi> Deane of Paules to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vtterer of their mindes. Who partly by ſpéech only, and partly by reading authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties written, &amp; at certaine times informed by his colleagues what to ſay, made a declaration of their meanings, and their reaſons to their firſt propoſitions. Which being ended, they were aſked by the priuy Counſaile, if any of them had any more to ſay? and they ſaide no. So the other were licenſed to ſhew their mindes: which they did according to their firſt order, exhibiting all that which they ment to propound, in a booke written: which (after prayer made moſt humbly to God, for the endewing of them with his holy ſpirit, &amp; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation alſo to ſtand to the doctrine of the Catholike church builded vpon the Scriptures, and the doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets &amp; Apoſtles) was diſtinctly read by one <hi>Robert Horne</hi> batcheler of Diuinitie, after B. of Wincheſter. Which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had doone with ſome likelihood (it ſéemed) that the ſame was much allowable to the audience, certayne of the B. began (contrary to their former anſwere) to ſay that they now had much to ſay to this matter. So it was ordered, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed vpon on both parts in full audience, that vpon munday following, the Biſhops ſhould bring their minds, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in writing to the ſecond aſſertion, and the laſt alſo (if they could) and firſt reade the ſame. And that done, the other part ſhould bring likewiſe theirs to the ſame: &amp; being read,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2659:398"/> each of them ſhould deliuer to other the ſame writings: and in the meane time the Biſhoppes ſhould put in writing, not onely that which Doctor <hi>Cole</hi> had that day vttered, but all ſuch other matters as they any otherwiſe coulde thinke of for the ſame. And aſſoone as they might poſſible, to ſend the ſame booke touching that firſt aſſertion to the other part, and they ſhould receiue of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the writing which Maſter <hi>Horne</hi> had read there that day. And vpon Munday it ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed, what day they ſhould exhibite their anſwers touching the firſt propoſition. This both parties aſſented vnto, and ſo the aſſemblie was quietly diſmiſſed.</p>
                  <p>On Munday, the aſſemblie being mette by the Lordes of the Counſell, and other of the Nobilitie, &amp;c. the Popiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops brake againe their order agréed vpon,<note place="margin">Papiſts break order againe.</note> and refuſed to deale in the ſecond Queſtion, according as it was agréed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but would néedes reade that which they had written of the firſt propoſition.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer they refuſed to beginne, but would haue the other part to beginne firſt, and beyng glad to auoyd altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cauſe for which they were aſſembled, began to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill with Maiſter <hi>Horne</hi> of what Church hée was of &amp; his fellowes: my Lord Kéeper perceiuing their digreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpoſe, admoniſhed them thereof. In the end they would not be brought to begin.
